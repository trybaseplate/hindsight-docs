  <Step icon="slack" title="Connect Slack">
    Add the Hindsight Slack App to your workspace to deliver competitive updates, battlecards, and insights directly to your team. First, add the bot to your Slack Workspace.
    Then, add Hindsight to a channel by typing ```@Hindsight``` in any channel and confirming the invite.

  <Step icon="bell" title="Customize Your Alerts">
    Configure the types of [alerts](https://app.usehindsight.com/settings/alerts) you want to receive. You can choose to receive a Weekly Newsletter and Real-Time Updates. You can choose what types of updates to receive based on the ```Sensitivity``` setting.
    You can choose "High Relevance" to only receive Real-Time Updates when something really important is detected, or decrease the sensitivity to receive more updates.

  <Step icon="crosshairs-simple" title="Add Your First Competitor">
     Add your [competitors](https://app.usehindsight.com/competitors) by domain. You can also add specific instructions for our AI agents to follow when tracking your competitors. For example, you can tell them to only track content about specific products, specific subdomain, or even specific keywords.

    Add more competitors by hitting the ```New``` button at the top right of your competitors page.

<Steps>
  <Step icon="slack" title="Connect Slack">
    Add the Hindsight Slack App to your workspace to deliver competitive updates, battlecards, and insights directly to your team. First, add the bot to your Slack Workspace.
    Then, add Hindsight to a channel by typing ```@Hindsight``` in any channel and confirming the invite.

  </Step>
  <Step icon="crosshairs-simple" title="Add Your First Competitor">
     Add your [competitors](https://app.usehindsight.com/competitors) by domain and configure URLs for tracking. Add their marketing site plus support or technical sites for best results. You can also add specific instructions for our AI agents to follow when tracking your competitors. For example, you can tell them to only track content about specific products, specific subdomain, or even specific keywords.
     
     Choose how often to scrape each page based on how frequently the content changes - daily for dynamic pages like blogs, weekly for product pages, or monthly for static content.

  </Step>
  <Step icon="user" title="Assign a Competitor Owner">
    Add an owner for each competitor who will be responsible for triaging competitive intelligence. The owner will be notified in Slack when new events are detected, allowing them to quickly review and alert the team about important competitive updates.
    
    Choose team members who are familiar with the competitive landscape and can make informed decisions about which updates require immediate attention.

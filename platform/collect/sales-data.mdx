## Overview
Hindsight collects sales data from every aspect of your deals to extract actionable win-loss insights. This automated process reviews CRM data, call transcripts, emails, and other sources to understand deal outcomes.

## Analysis Process
1. **Data Gathering**: Collect all deal-related information (CRM, calls, emails, notes, win-loss interviews) during daily syncs with your sales tools
2. **AI Analysis**: Hindsight uses AI to review data and extract insights using decision drivers, competitors, features, and custom metrics
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Data is visualized in dashboards, reports, and via the Chat interface

See [Salesforce Integration](/integrations/salesforce-integration) and [HubSpot Integration](/integrations/hubspot-integration) for CRM sync details.

## Overview
Competitive Monitoring is Hindsight's always-on intelligence system that tracks competitor moves, product updates, and market changes across hundreds of data sources. Instead of manually researching competitors, let AI continuously gather and analyze competitive intelligence 24/7.

## How It Works
Hindsight runs automated competitor syncs **every weekday at 1 AM EST**. Each competitor gets monitored across multiple channels simultaneously:

- **Website Monitoring**: Daily scans of competitor websites, product pages, and documentation
- **Social Intelligence**: LinkedIn, Twitter/X posts and company updates  
- **Advertising Tracking**: LinkedIn Ads, Google Ads campaigns and messaging
- **Review Analysis**: G2, Capterra, and other review platform monitoring
- **News & Press**: Google News alerts and industry publication mentions
- **Community Forums**: Slack workspaces, Discord servers, and relevant discussions

## Getting Started
1. **Add Competitors**: Define which companies to monitor and their key URLs/profiles
2. **Configure Sources**: Enable relevant monitoring channels (website, social, ads, reviews) and how often to scan
3. **Set Up Notifications**: Choose a competitor owner who will get alerted in Slack to new intelligence ready for triage
4. **Review Intelligence**: Triage new competitive events in the Hindsight app and share relevant insights with your team

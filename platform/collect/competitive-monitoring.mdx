## Overview
Competitive Monitoring is now powered by Hindsight's AI agent and workflows system, giving you complete control over how competitive intelligence is gathered, analyzed, and delivered to your team.

Each competitor you track gets an automated "Competitive Monitor" workflow that runs on a weekly schedule (Mondays at 11am EST by default). You can customize the schedule, the research recipe, and how results are delivered.

## How It Works

### Agent-Powered Research
The Competitive Monitor workflow uses Hindsight's AI agent with access to powerful research tools:

- **Web Search** — Live search for real-time competitor information, news, and product updates
- **Scrape URL** — Extract and analyze content from specific web pages (pricing pages, docs, blogs)
- **Map URL** *(experimental)* — Discover and index subpages from a given URL to find all relevant content
- **Browse Tool** *(experimental)* — Full browser capabilities for research on bot-protected sources like LinkedIn and G2

### Intel Library
When the agent finds valuable intelligence, it gets saved to your Intel Library—a dedicated space for competitive research materials:

- **Centralized Organization**: Keep approved, high-quality insights organized and accessible
- **Team Access**: Surface materials via the Slack Agent and other enablement workflows
- **Auto-Sync**: Saved pages are automatically indexed and synced regularly to stay current and detect changes

## Getting Started

1. **Add Competitors**: Navigate to Competitors and add the companies you want to track
2. **Enable Monitoring**: Toggle monitoring on for each competitor you want to track actively
3. **Customize Workflows**: Each competitor gets a default "Competitive Monitor" workflow—remix the recipe to customize research focus, output format, and delivery
4. **Configure Delivery**: Set up Slack channels, email recipients, or other output actions for your workflow results

## Customizing Your Monitoring

### Workflow Recipes
Each competitor's monitoring workflow starts with a default Recipe that you can remix and customize:

- **Research Focus**: Adjust the prompt to prioritize product updates, pricing changes, marketing campaigns, or other areas
- **Output Format**: Configure how insights are formatted—executive summaries, detailed reports, battlecard updates, etc.
- **Source Priorities**: Specify which sources to emphasize (website, LinkedIn, G2, news, etc.)

### Schedule Configuration
Default schedule is weekly (Mondays at 11am EST), but you can customize:

- **Frequency**: Daily, weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly
- **Day & Time**: Choose what works best for your team's workflow
- **Per-Competitor Schedules**: Set different cadences for different competitors based on priority

### Delivery Options
Configure how and where results are delivered:

- **Slack Channels**: Push updates directly to dedicated competitive intelligence channels
- **Slack DMs**: Send to specific team members (e.g., competitor owners)
- **Email**: Distribute to broader teams via email lists
- **Library Updates**: Automatically update battlecards and competitive assets in your Library

## Intelligence Processing

### AI-Powered Analysis
The agent analyzes gathered intelligence to surface:

- **Key Developments**: Product launches, pricing changes, funding, partnerships
- **Strategic Implications**: How changes affect your competitive positioning
- **Recommended Actions**: Suggested updates to messaging or battlecards

### Event Categorization
Intelligence is automatically categorized by type and priority:

**High Priority** — Immediate attention:
- Major product launches or significant updates
- Pricing changes or new packaging tiers
- Acquisitions, mergers, or strategic partnerships
- Executive leadership changes
- Funding rounds or IPO announcements

**Medium Priority** — Weekly review:
- New marketing campaigns or positioning changes
- Customer case studies and success stories
- Key personnel hires or departures
- Reviews and third-party comparisons

**Low Priority** — Background intelligence:
- Minor website updates or blog posts
- General social media activity
- Small feature updates

## Using Intelligence in Chat

All competitive intelligence is accessible via Hindsight's AI chat:

- **Ask Questions**: "What has Competitor X announced in the last month?"
- **Build Assets**: "Create a battlecard update based on Competitor X's latest product launch"
- **Compare**: "How does our pricing compare to Competitor X after their recent changes?"

The agent will pull from your Intel Library and can run live research to fill gaps.

## Migration Notes

If you previously had competitive monitoring set up, your configuration has been automatically migrated:

- Existing competitors with monitoring enabled now have Competitive Monitor workflows
- Default Recipe provides similar coverage to the previous system
- You can remix the recipe to customize or enhance your monitoring

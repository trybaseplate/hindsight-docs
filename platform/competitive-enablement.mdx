## Overview
Use the AI Assistant to research what is working / not working in the field, then turn insights into data-driven, shareable assets that live in your Asset Library. These assets power sales enablement in Slack and across your team.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find Context with Chat">
    Ask the AI for competitive analysis, comparisons, objection handling, or messaging. The assistant will pull the right sources to build a foundation. See the <a href="/guides/prompting">Prompting Guide</a> for tips.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Asset from a Response">
    When you get a useful answer, click <b>Create Asset</b> on that message. Give it a clear title and optionally tag a competitor.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Edit & Organize in Library">
    The asset is saved to your Library with metadata (author, date, source chat) and is fully searchable. Edit in the markdown editor and organize as needed.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Share with Sales">
    Share links directly or use Slack to surface assets in-channel. Team members can find and use the latest enablement content without leaving Slack.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Keep Current">
    Refresh assets as the market changes by iterating in chat and updating the document. Your Library remains the source of truth.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Creating Assets via Chat

### 1. Generate the right content
Use the assistant to pull evidence and synthesize:
- Competitive positioning and differentiation
- Product comparisons and capability summaries
- Objection handling and talk tracks
- Pricing and packaging references from deals

Tip: Provide explicit goals and steps, and start focused threads per task. See <a href="/guides/prompting">Prompting Guide</a> for examples on chaining tools (Deal Search, Search Across Deals, Search Within Deal, Competitor Search).

### 2. Convert to an asset
- Click <b>Create Asset</b> on any AI response
- Add a descriptive title (e.g., “Competitor B – Enterprise Objection Guide”)
- Optionally select a <b>Competitor</b> to tag and organize
- The asset is stored in <b>Library → Documents</b> and indexed for search

### 3. Edit and maintain
Open the asset in the editor to polish

## Common asset types
- Battlecards and competitive one-pagers
- Pricing and packaging briefs
- Objection handling guides
- Product/feature comparison briefs
- Deal-specific talking points and executive summaries
- Landing page and marketing content

## Sharing in Slack
Surface assets where the team works:
- Share asset links in relevant channels
- Use chat to request assets or have AI reference saved materials
- Optional slash command support to retrieve assets by name or competitor (e.g., <code>/assets Salesforce</code>)

## Best practices
- Start a new chat for each task to avoid context overflow
- Be explicit about the outcome you need and the audience
- Tag competitors to improve discoverability
- Title assets clearly for search and re-use
- Keep content tight, factual, and backed by sources

## Getting started
<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Chat">
    Navigate to AI chat and describe the asset you need (e.g., “Create objection handling for Competitor X for an enterprise buyer”).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Refine the Draft">
    Ask follow-ups to add quotes, proof points, or comparisons until it’s ready.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Asset">
    Click <b>Create Asset</b>, name it, and tag a competitor if relevant.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Edit & Share">
    Find it in <b>Library → Documents</b>, make edits, then share the link or post in Slack.
  </Step>
</Steps>

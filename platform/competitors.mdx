## What is Competitor Monitoring?
Competitor Monitoring is a feature that allows you to **track your competitors' activities and gather insights** about their products, pricing, and marketing strategies. This helps you stay informed about the competitive landscape and make data-driven decisions for your business.

Hindsight uses AI Agents to execute end-to-end Deep Research workflows daily - allowing you to **gather real-time updates about competitor activities**. This includes monitoring each competitor's website, social media, and other online sources for updates on product launches, pricing changes, and other relevant news.

### How it Works
Once you add a competitor, our AI agents will automatically begin researching. Our AI Agents are using advanced reasoning and a broswer to get into all the places a human would to find intel.

1. **AI Finds Relevant Sources**: Our AI agents will crawl the web and find sources to monitor for you, no manual input required.
2. **Daily Sync**: Hindsight will sync the latest data from your competitors every 24 hours, ensuring you have the most up-to-date information.
3. **Alerts and Notifications**: Hindsight creates a weekly newsletter and notifications when significant changes occur, such as new product launches or pricing updates.

## Get insights
### News Feed
On your [News Feed](https://app.usehindsight.com/feed) page, you can view a news feed of the latest updates from your competitors. Hindsight groups similar updates into "Events" to prevent duplicated alerts, generates summaries, and assigns relevance scores.
You can filter the feed by competitor, relevance, or type of content. You can also bookmark or delete any irrelevant content from the feed to keep the feed clean and focused.

Based on your settings, Hindsight will send you a weekly newsletter and real-time updates via Slack. You can customize the types of updates you want to receive and the frequency of notifications. Hindsight will also send you alerts when significant changes occur, such as new product launches or pricing updates.

## Customizing Monitoring
### Default Sources
- **Website**: Monitor your competitors' websites for changes in content, product offerings, and pricing. Provide one URL and our AI will monitor the entire site. **For technical products, we recommend adding documentation sites or support sites**.
- **Social Media**: Track your competitors' social media accounts on LinkedIn and Twitter for updates on new products, promotions, and customer engagement.
- **Articles**: Stay informed about your competitors through news articles, blog posts, and press releases from any source available via Google.
- **Job Postings**: Analyze your competitors' hiring trends and job postings to gain insights into their growth and focus areas.
- **Customer Reviews**: Monitor customer feedback and reviews on sites like G2, Capterra, and various blogs to understand how your competitors are perceived in the market.
- **Marketing Campaigns**: Analyze your competitors' paid marketing campaigns on Google and LinkedIn to understand their strategies and messaging.

### Customizing Sources
You can customize the sources that Hindsight monitors for each competitor. For example, you can add a documentation sitemap! Hit the ```...``` icon next to each type of source to add or remove sources.

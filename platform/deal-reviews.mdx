## Overview
Deal Reviews is Hindsight's comprehensive analysis engine that automatically processes your closed deals to generate structured win-loss insights. Instead of manual post-mortems, AI analyzes all your deal documents, CRM data, and conversations to create detailed deal stories with actionable recommendations.

## How Deal Analysis Works

## Overview
Use AI to analyze your closed deals to generate structured win-loss insights. AI analyzes all your deal documents, CRM data, and conversations to create detailed deal stories with actionable recommendations.

## How Deal Analysis Works

### Data Sources Processing
Hindsight analyzes multiple data sources from each deal:
- **CRM Properties**: Deal stage history, custom fields, and opportunity data
- **Meeting Recordings**: Gong calls, Zoom transcripts, customer conversations
- **Deal Documents**: Proposals, contracts, emails, notes, and attachments
- **Win-Loss Interviews**: Structured feedback from buyers and internal teams

Deal data is synced automatically every 12 hours for the deals you select to import for analysis. Auto-import rules can be configured to automate the win-loss analysis process end-to-end.

### Outputs
For every analyzed deal, Hindsight creates a comprehensive deal story containing:

- **Executive Summary**
- **Timeline**
- **Stakeholders**
- **Decision Drivers Analysis**
- **Competitive Landscape**
- **Key Quotes & Evidence**
- **Lessons Learned & Recommendations**

## Structured Insights Extraction

### Decision Driver Analysis
Hindsight maps deal conversations to your organization's decision drivers:
- **Automated Detection**: AI identifies mentions of your configured decision drivers
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Positive, negative, or neutral perception of each driver
- **Impact Scoring**: Relative importance of each driver in the decision
- **Supporting Evidence**: Specific quotes and context for each driver

### Feature Tracking
Track which product capabilities influenced the deal:
- **Feature Mentions**: Automatic detection of product feature discussions
- **Customer Sentiment**: How buyers perceived specific capabilities
- **Competitive Context**: Features compared against competitor offerings

### Competitive Intelligence
Comprehensive competitor analysis for every deal:
- **Competitor Identification**: Automatic detection and tagging of competitors
- **Precision Tagging**: Automatically classify if competitors were incumbents, primary, or secondary
- **Outcome Classification**: Whether competitors were mentioned, evaluated, or selected
- **Positioning Analysis**: How competitors were positioned vs. your solution

### Custom Insights:
Create custom prompts to extract specific insights:
- **Metrics**: AI evaluates deals against a 1-5 scale rubric
- **Answers**: Free-form answers with configurable prompts, length, and format

## CRM Integration & Sync-Back

### Automated CRM Updates
Hindsight automatically syncs insights back to your CRM

- **Win/Loss Reasons**: Populate standardized win/loss reasons
- **Deal Summary**: Executive summary in deal notes
- **Competitors**: Update competitor fields with detected competitors
- **Features**: Populate features discussed in the deal

Requires HubSpot or Salesforce integration with Admin / Write access.

## Analysis Triggers & Automation

### Automatic Analysis
Deals are automatically analyzed when:
- Deal stage changes to "Closed Won" or "Closed Lost"
- Deal meets auto-import criteria (configured in settings)
- New deal data is available (win-loss interviews, CRM properties)

### Manual Analysis
You can also trigger analysis manually:
- For deals that need re-analysis after new information
- To focus on specific decision drivers or competitors
- When filtering by particular document types
- For historical deals that weren't previously analyzed

### Automated Feedback Collection
Collect feedback from stakeholders with automated win-loss interviews:
- Internal team feedback requests via Slack and email
- External buyer feedback through automated surveys

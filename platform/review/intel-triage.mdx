## Overview
Intel Triage is the process of reviewing new competitive intelligence, prioritizing updates, and sharing relevant insights with your team. Hindsight automates the collection of competitive data and provides a streamlined workflow for human review and distribution.

## How the Triage Process Works

### 1. Configure Competitive Tracking
Set up your competitors with the right monitoring sources to ensure AI scrapes relevant intel daily:
- **Website Monitoring**: Configure specific pages to track (marketing site, docs, support pages)
- **Social & Ads**: Monitor LinkedIn, X (Twitter), Google Ads, and LinkedIn Ads
- **Reviews & Forums**: Track G2 reviews, Slack communities, Discord servers
- **News & Press**: Monitor Google News for company mentions
- **Scraping Schedule**: Choose frequency (daily, weekly, monthly) based on content type

### 2. AI Creates Events for Triage  
When new competitive intel is detected, AI automatically:
- **Analyzes Content**: Reviews documents for relevance and competitive significance
- **Groups Similar Updates**: Creates "Events" to prevent duplicate alerts (e.g., multiple social posts about the same product launch)
- **Assigns Relevance Scores**: Rates updates as Low (1), Medium (2), or High (3) importance
- **Generates Summaries**: Creates concise descriptions of what changed and why it matters

### 3. Owner Notification in Slack
Each competitor can have an assigned owner who gets notified when new events are detected:
- **Direct Messages**: Owner receives Slack DMs with summary of new updates
- **Triage Links**: Quick access to review and act on new competitive intel
- **Update Count**: Shows how many new events need attention
- **Filtering**: Links directly to competitor-specific feed for focused review

### 4. Triage and Share Updates
Use the [Alerts Feed](https://app.usehindsight.com/feed) to review and act on competitive intel:

**Triage Actions:**
- **Review**: Examine the full content and AI-generated summary
- **Rewrite**: Edit the message to add context or improve clarity  
- **Send to Slack**: Share updates with relevant channels and teams
- **Delete**: Remove irrelevant or duplicate content
- **Bookmark**: Save important updates for future reference

**Sharing Options:**
- **Channel Selection**: Choose which Slack channels receive the update
- **Custom Messages**: Tailor the message for different audiences (sales, product, leadership)
- **Immediate Distribution**: Send high-priority updates immediately
- **Batch Sharing**: Group related updates for weekly summaries

## Alert Management

### Untriaged Badge System
New competitive events show an "Untriaged" badge until reviewed, helping you:
- **Track Pending Reviews**: See what still needs attention
- **Maintain Quality**: Ensure nothing gets missed
- **Measure Response Time**: Monitor how quickly team responds to competitive changes

### Filtering and Organization  
The feed can be filtered by:
- **Competitor**: Focus on specific companies
- **Relevance Score**: High/Medium/Low priority updates
- **Content Type**: Website changes, ads, social posts, news, reviews
- **Date Range**: Recent updates vs. historical intel
- **Triage Status**: Pending vs. completed reviews

## Best Practices for Effective Triage

### Setting Up Competitor Owners
- **Domain Experts**: Assign owners who understand the competitive landscape in their area
- **Response Time**: Ensure owners can review updates within 24-48 hours
- **Backup Coverage**: Have secondary reviewers for when primary owners are unavailable
- **Training**: Brief owners on relevance scoring and what constitutes actionable intel

### Optimizing Alert Quality
- **Tune Relevance Thresholds**: Adjust AI scoring to reduce noise while catching important updates
- **Custom Instructions**: Provide specific guidance for each competitor (e.g., "focus on enterprise features")
- **Source Selection**: Monitor high-value pages more frequently than static content
- **Regular Review**: Periodically assess and refine monitoring sources

### Team Communication
- **Channel Strategy**: Create dedicated channels for different types of updates (product, marketing, executive)
- **Context Addition**: Always add business context when sharing competitive intel
- **Action Items**: Include clear next steps when sharing high-priority updates
- **Follow-up**: Track how competitive intel influences product and go-to-market decisions

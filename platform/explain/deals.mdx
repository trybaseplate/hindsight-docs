## Overview
Hindsight's dashboards turn your deal data into actionable win-loss insights. Track performance over time, understand why you win or lose, and drill into competitors, drivers, and features. 
Filter to specific segments to uncover patterns that improve win rates.

## Key insight types
- **Win Rate & Trends**: Overall win rate and change vs. prior period
- **Reasons & Themes**: Decision drivers with sentiment and evidence
- **Competitor Impact**: Frequency, win rate vs. each competitor, affected revenue
- **Deal Metrics**: Compare selected metrics across All/Won/Lost, with deltas vs. previous period (bar or line view)
- **Feature Mentions**: Capabilities most associated with wins/losses

## Where this data comes from
- **Deal Labeling**: Each analyzed deal is labeled with your organization’s configured taxonomy for:
  - Decision Drivers (with sentiment and estimated impact)
  - Competitors (with role such as Primary, Incumbent, Secondary)
  - Features (mentions and sentiment)
- **User-Controlled Taxonomy**: Admins define and update drivers, competitors, and features; teams can review or adjust labels at the deal level.
- **Impact Estimation & Rollups**: Per‑deal labels and impact scores are aggregated into the dashboard’s charts and KPIs (e.g., driver influence, competitor win rates, feature associations).
- **Quantifiable Trends Over Time**: Insights are bucketed by close date and respect your filters, enabling time‑series analysis and comparisons to prior periods.

## Charts in this dashboard
- **Win Rate (Pie)**: Overall Won vs. Lost for the current filter window.
- **Competitor Win Rate (Bar, vertical list)**:
  - Sort by: Alphabetical, Deal count (total/won/lost), Win rate, Amount
  - Toggle: Primary competitor only
  - Shows win rate and affected revenue per competitor
- **Competitive Deals Volume**: Deals involving each competitor (stacked Won/Lost)
- **Decision Drivers**:
  - Bar chart: Positive / Neutral / Negative counts per driver
  - Scatter: Frequency vs. impact visualization for drivers
  - Table: Sortable driver table with supporting details
- **Deal Metrics (Bar/Line)**:
  - Select one or more metrics (defaults + any custom metrics)
  - Compare All vs. Won vs. Lost averages
  - Deltas vs. the previous period (▲/▼) where available
  - Line view groups by day or month based on date range

## Filters & segmentation
Use filters to isolate insights for specific contexts. Available filters include:
- **Date Range (close_date)**: From/To with automatic previous-period calculation
- **Outcome / Status**: Won, Lost, specific stages, previous status
- **Competitor**: Pick one or many; filter by **competitor_role** (Primary, Incumbent, Secondary); or use **any_competitor**
- **Decision Drivers**: Filter by **driver** or a **single_driver** with **sentiment** (positive/neutral/negative)
- **Features & Mentions**: Filter by feature, mention, and product labels
- **Deal Properties**: Amount (min/max), deal_type, region, segment, industry
- **People**: owner_ids (reps), collaborators, teams
- **Documents/Labels**: document, label, intel_label/intel_relevance (if enabled)
- **CRM Filters**:
  - Salesforce/HubSpot deal property filters (salesforce_filters, hubspot_filters)
  - Salesforce/HubSpot account property filters (salesforce_filters_account, hubspot_filters_account)
- **Analysis Flags**: deal_analyzed, analysis_verified, external

All charts, tables, and KPIs respect the active filters.

### Examples
- “Win rate vs. Competitor A for Enterprise (segment) in Q2, Primary competitor only.”
- “Top negative decision drivers for Lost deals in EMEA last 90 days.”
- “Compare deal metrics as a line chart month-by-month for SMB vs. Mid-Market.”
- “Which features are most associated with wins in fintech?”

## Drill down and evidence
- Hover for tooltips; sort competitor and driver views to explore patterns
- Click into tables to review underlying deals and supporting evidence (quotes, docs)
- Move from pattern to concrete examples for coaching and enablement

## Use with the AI Assistant
- Ask the assistant to analyze the current segment (e.g., “Summarize why we lose vs. Competitor C in healthcare last quarter and draft an objection guide”).
- Convert results into a shareable document with **Create Asset** and save to **Library → Documents**.
- See: <a href="/platform/ai-assistant">AI Assistant</a> and <a href="/platform/competitive-enablement">Competitive Enablement</a>.

## Best practices
- Start broad, then add filters one at a time to isolate effects
- Use the **Primary competitor only** toggle for apples-to-apples comparisons
- Compare to the previous period to spot momentum (look for ▲/▼ deltas)
- Validate insights by clicking through to example deals and quotes
- Turn recurring findings into assets for sales coaching and PM feedback

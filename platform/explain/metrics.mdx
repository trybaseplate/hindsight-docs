## Overview
Metrics are custom business dimensions that let you score and analyze deals beyond standard revenue and stage tracking. Using a 1-5 scale, metrics help quantify qualitative aspects of your sales process and identify patterns that drive success.

## Metric Structure
- **Name**: Clear, specific dimension (e.g., "Champion Strength")
- **Description**: What this metric measures and how to score it
- **Scale Definition**: What each score (1-5) represents
- **Use Case**: When and why to apply this metric

## Scoring Framework
All metrics use a consistent 1-5 scale:
- **5**: Excellent/Ideal state
- **4**: Good/Above average  
- **3**: Average/Neutral
- **2**: Below average/Concerning
- **1**: Poor/Major risk

## Common Metric Types

### Sales Process Quality
- **Champion Strength**: How well-positioned and influential your champion is
- **Buying Process Clarity**: How well-defined the customer's evaluation process is
- **Decision Timeline**: Urgency and clarity of purchase timing
- **Budget Authority**: Access to and influence over purchasing decisions

### Technical Fit
- **Solution Alignment**: How well your product matches their requirements
- **Implementation Complexity**: Ease of deployment and integration
- **Technical Champion Buy-in**: Support from technical stakeholders
- **Competitive Positioning**: Strength against alternatives

### Strategic Value
- **Business Impact**: Potential value delivery to customer
- **Strategic Importance**: Priority level within customer organization
- **Executive Sponsorship**: C-level support and involvement
- **Expansion Potential**: Opportunity for future growth

## Metric Analytics
- **Deal Correlation**: Which metrics predict deal success
- **Score Distribution**: How deals perform across different metric ranges
- **Trend Analysis**: How metric scores change throughout sales cycles
- **Segmentation**: Deal performance by metric combinations
- **Forecasting**: Use metric patterns to predict deal outcomes

## Setup Process
1. **Define Dimension**: What business aspect you want to measure
2. **Create Scale**: Define what each 1-5 score represents
3. **Train Team**: Ensure consistent scoring across sales reps
4. **Apply Systematically**: Score deals consistently throughout pipeline
5. **Analyze Patterns**: Use data to identify success factors

## Best Practices
- **Clear Definitions**: Make scoring criteria objective and specific

- **Decision Driver Analysis**: Link strategic metrics to buyer priorities
- **Competitive Intelligence**: Inform positioning metrics with market data

## Reporting & Insights
- **Metric Dashboards**: Visual summaries of deal performance by dimension
- **Correlation Analysis**: Which metrics most strongly predict outcomes
- **Team Performance**: How different reps score and succeed with metrics
- **Pipeline Health**: Early warning indicators from metric trends
- **Win/Loss Patterns**: Metric profiles of successful vs. unsuccessful deals

## Common Use Cases

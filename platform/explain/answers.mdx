## Overview
Custom Answers let you create AI-generated answer fields that automatically extract qualitative insights from your deals. Write a prompt once, and AI will analyze every deal to provide consistent, structured answers based on the complete deal context including CRM data, call transcripts, and decision drivers.

## How It Works
1. **Create Custom Prompts**: Define questions you want answered about every deal
2. **AI Analysis**: AI reads the full deal context to generate answers automatically  
3. **Structured Insights**: Get consistent, comparable data across your pipeline
4. **Export & Integrate**: Use answers in analytics, reporting, and CRM sync

## Answer Types & Formats

### Answer Length Options
- **True/False**: Binary responses with brief justification (1-2 sentences)
- **Sentence**: Concise insights in a single sentence (10-20 words)
- **Paragraph**: Detailed analysis in short paragraphs (50-150 words)

### Common Use Cases

#### Deal Qualification & Risk
- "Was budget confirmed?" (True/False)
- "What was the main objection raised?"
- "Is there a clear champion identified?" (True/False)

#### Competitive Analysis  
- "Who were the main competitors in this deal?"
- "How did we position against [Competitor X]?"
- "What competitive objections came up?"

#### Sales Process & Coaching
- "What coaching advice would help this rep?"
- "What went wrong in this deal?" 
- "Describe the buyer's decision process"

#### Executive Summaries
- "Provide an executive summary of this deal outcome"
- "What were the key success factors?"
- "Summarize lessons learned from this deal"

## AI Analysis Context
When generating answers, AI analyzes comprehensive deal data:

### Data Sources
- **CRM Fields**: Deal properties, stage history, and custom fields
- **Call Transcripts**: Full conversation content from Gong, Chorus, or other platforms
- **Decision Drivers**: Identified buyer priorities and their sentiment
- **Competitive Intel**: Mentions of competitors and positioning
- **Document Content**: Proposals, contracts, and other deal materials
- **Deal Story**: AI-generated narrative of the deal progression

### Answer Quality
- **Evidence-Based**: Answers cite specific quotes and data points
- **Confidence Scoring**: AI provides confidence levels (0-100%) for each answer
- **Contextual**: Responses consider deal stage, outcome, and stakeholders
- **Consistent**: Same prompts generate comparable answers across deals

## Best Practices

### Writing Effective Prompts
- **Be Specific**: "What was the main pricing objection?" vs. "Any objections?"
- **Define Context**: Specify if you want buyer vs. seller perspective
- **Set Expectations**: Indicate desired detail level and format
- **Focus**: One clear question per prompt works better than multiple

### Prompt Examples

**Good Prompts:**
- "Was a clear champion identified who actively advocated for our solution?" (True/False)
- "What was the buyer's main concern about implementation complexity?"
- "Summarize the competitive landscape and our positioning in 2-3 sentences"

**Avoid:**
- Vague: "How did the deal go?"
- Multiple questions: "Who was involved and what did they think and what happened next?"
- Overly complex: Long, multi-part prompts with sub-questions

### Data Quality Tips
- **Verify Samples**: Review AI answers on a few deals to check accuracy
- **Iterate Prompts**: Refine wording based on answer quality
- **Set Standards**: Train team on what constitutes a complete deal record
- **Monitor Confidence**: Low confidence scores may indicate insufficient data

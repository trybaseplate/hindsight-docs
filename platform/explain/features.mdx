## Overview
Features represent specific, atomic capabilities of your product that customers discuss, request, and evaluate during the sales process. Unlike high-level decision drivers, features are concrete product capabilities like "SSO Integration" or "API Rate Limiting."

## Feature Structure
- **Name**: Clear, specific capability name (e.g., "Single Sign-On")
- **Description**: Detailed explanation of what the feature does
- **Product**: Which product the feature belongs to
- **Product Area**: Functional category (Security, Analytics, Integrations)

## Organization Hierarchy
```
Product (e.g., "Hindsight CI")
├── Product Area (e.g., "Security")
│   ├── Feature (e.g., "SSO Integration")
│   ├── Feature (e.g., "Audit Logs")
│   └── Feature (e.g., "Role-based Access")
└── Product Area (e.g., "Analytics")
    ├── Feature (e.g., "Custom Dashboards")
    └── Feature (e.g., "Data Export")
```

## How Features Work
1. **Detection**: AI automatically identifies feature mentions in deal conversations
2. **Sentiment Tracking**: Monitors positive/negative discussions about each feature
3. **Revenue Attribution**: Connects features to deal outcomes and value
4. **Competitive Analysis**: Compares your features against competitor capabilities
5. **Performance Analytics**: Tracks which features drive deal success

## Setup Methods
- **Manual Creation**: Add individual features with full descriptions
- **CSV Import**: Bulk upload up to 50 features at once
- **AI Detection**: System suggests features based on deal conversations
- **Team Collaboration**: Multiple team members can contribute to feature catalog

## Analytics & Insights
- **Mention Frequency**: How often features are discussed in deals
- **Sentiment Trends**: Whether customer perception is improving or declining
- **Revenue Impact**: Total deal value associated with feature mentions
- **Competitive Gaps**: Features where competitors have advantages
- **Win Correlation**: Which features appear most in successful deals

## Best Practices
- **Atomic Granularity**: Each feature should be a specific, discrete capability
- **Customer Language**: Use terms customers actually use, not internal jargon
- **Consistent Taxonomy**: Maintain clear product and area categories
- **Regular Maintenance**: Update descriptions as features evolve
- **Cross-functional Input**: Include product, sales, and customer success perspectives

## Common Use Cases
- **Product Roadmap**: Prioritize features based on customer demand and revenue impact
- **Competitive Positioning**: Understand feature gaps and advantages
- **Sales Enablement**: Help reps understand which features resonate with buyers
- **Customer Success**: Identify features driving adoption and expansion

## Overview
Sales battlecards provide your GTM teams with the information they need to handle questions like "how are you different from X?". 
The main challenge with battlecards is that they're usually based on the "vibes and intuition" of whoever created them, instead of data (plus they quickly become outdated).

Hindsight's battlecards are data-driven and generated in real-time - learning from what has actually been working.

Note: Sales battlecards aren't focused on nitty-gritty technical differentiators, but tactical insights that can help sellers win deals (usually not feature dumping).

For technical differentiators, we recommend using the [Product Comparison](https://docs.usehindsight.com/platform/feature-comparison) card.

## How it Works
Hindsight uses a few types of data for sales battelcards: 
1. Publicly available information about your competitors
2. Your own product information
3. What buyers tell you during deals and win-loss interviews (prioritized above all else).

Hindsight uses these insights to generate personalized battlecards for your sales team. When new intelligence comes in, Hindsight automatically suggests updates.

## Generating and Editing Cards
Battlecards are composed of individual cards, each focused on a specific insight that can help you win deals. Each card is powered by a unique workflow that pulls in relevant data from your CRM, call data, win-loss interviews, and competitive insights.
Cards are editable, allowing you to customize the content and layout to fit your team's needs. You can re-generate a card at any time.

These are they core talking points your sales team should use on calls.

### Objection Handling
This card highlights the core objections your sales team has faced, and how to address them on calls. These insights come from negative quotes about your product in deals you lost to your competitor.

### Landmine Questions
This card provides a list of questions that your sales team should ask during calls to position your team as a trusted consultant with the prospect, while also uncovering potential weaknesses in your competitor's offering. 
These questions are based on your win drivers versus your competitor.

### Customers Who Chose Us
These are the best and most recent examples of customers who chose you over your competitor. This card highlights the key accounts that have chosen you, along with their logos and a brief description of why they made the switch.

## Slack Integration
Battlecards are meant to be interacted with via Slack. By adding the Hindsight [Slack App](https://docs.usehindsight.com/guides/slack), your sales team can access insights by mentioning Hindsight in any channel or DM.
Just use the slash command ``` /hindsight [competitor name] ``` to instantly retrieve a battlecard.

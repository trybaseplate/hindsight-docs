## Overview
Features are the core capabilities of your product that customers discuss, request, and evaluate during the sales process. Hindsight's Features system helps you track these conversations, understand feature performance, and make data-driven product decisions.

Unlike high-level decision drivers (like "Security" or "Ease of Use"), features represent specific, atomic capabilities like "SSO Integration," "API Rate Limiting," or "Custom Fields."

## Setting Up Features

### Creating Features
Navigate to **Settings > Features** to manage your feature catalog:

1. **Name** (required): Clear, specific feature name (e.g., "Single Sign-On", "Audit Logs")
2. **Description** (optional): Detailed explanation of what the feature does
3. **Product** (optional): Which product this feature belongs to (e.g., "Hindsight CI", "Hindsight Research")
4. **Product Area** (optional): Functional category (e.g., "Security", "Analytics", "Integrations")

### Bulk Import
For teams with extensive feature lists:

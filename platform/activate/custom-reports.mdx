## Overview
Custom Reports transforms your deal data into actionable insights through AI-powered analysis. Build custom datasets from your deals and let Hindsight's AI analyze trends in sales execution, product feedback, competitive intelligence, and win/loss patterns.

## Getting Started
Navigate to the **Reports** tab in your Hindsight dashboard to access the report builder. The reports feature is designed around two key steps:
1. **Dataset Creation**: Filter and configure the deal data you want to analyze
2. **AI Analysis**: Let Hindsight's AI extract insights and generate comprehensive reports

### Report Types
Choose from different analytical approaches:
- **Win-Loss Overview**: High-level insights for leadership consumption
- **Sales Execution**: Detailed findings for sales team action items
- **Product Insights**: Feature prioritization based on deal feedback
- **Market Intelligence**: Focus on market and competitor dynamics

## Building Your Dataset

### Applying Filters
Use the filter options to narrow down your analysis to the most relevant deals:
- **Deal Status**: Focus on closed won, closed lost, or open deals
- **Time Period**: Analyze deals from specific timeframes (last 30 days, quarter, etc.)
- **Deal Segments**: Filter by new business, expansion, renewal, or other segments
- **Custom Properties**: Include specific account or deal properties relevant to your analysis

<Note>
You can analyze up to 100 deals at once for optimal AI performance and comprehensive insights.

### Configuring Columns
By default, Hindsight includes key fields that provide the richest analysis:
- **Competition Drivers**: Competitive factors that influenced the deal
- **Features**: Product capabilities discussed or requested
- **Metrics**: Deal size, timeline, and other quantitative data
- **Explanations**: Contextual information about deal outcomes

#### Adding Custom Fields
Expand your analysis by including additional data points:
- **Custom Answers**: Specific questions you track in Hindsight
- **Account Properties**: Company size, industry, geography, and other firmographics
- **Deal Properties**: Sales rep, deal source, product line, and other deal-specific data

## Generating Reports

### Creating the Report
1. Configure your filters and columns to create the desired dataset

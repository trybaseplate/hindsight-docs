## Overview
Feature Comparisons provide technical deep-dives into competitor products that help you understand your competitive strengths and weaknesses. Using AI-powered analysis across multiple data sources, you can quickly build comprehensive competitive assessments without spending hours researching documentation or debating with your product team.

The system automatically stays up-to-date with new competitor releases and intelligence.

These visual comparisons (sometimes known as Harvey Ball charts) give you instant insight into your competitive landscape.

## How it Works
Building Feature Comparisons is streamlined with our new AI-powered workflow:

### 1. Set Up Your Features
First, define the features you want to track in the **Features** section:
- Navigate to **Settings > Features** to create your feature catalog
- Add specific capabilities like "SSO Integration," "API Rate Limiting," or "Custom Dashboards"
- Include detailed descriptions to help AI understand the feature scope
- Organize by product and product area for better analysis

### 2. Generate Competitive Analysis
For each competitor, Hindsight automatically analyzes their feature support:
- Visit any competitor's page and click **"Generate Analysis"**
- AI researches across documents, websites, and your deal intelligence
- Each feature receives a 1-4 score with detailed explanation
- Source documents are automatically cited for verification

## Scoring System

Each feature receives a standardized 1-4 score:

- **1 - Not Supported** ðŸ”´: Feature is not available or very limited
- **2 - Limited Support** ðŸŸ¡: Basic implementation with significant limitations  
- **3 - Good Support** ðŸ”µ: Solid implementation covering most use cases
- **4 - Excellent Support** ðŸŸ¢: Comprehensive implementation, potentially best-in-class

This scoring provides consistent evaluation across features and competitors, making it easy to identify competitive gaps and strengths.

## Enhanced Data Sources

When building Feature Comparisons, Hindsight analyzes multiple intelligence sources:

### 1. Internal Intelligence

All sources are automatically cited, giving you confidence in the analysis and ability to drill down into specific evidence.

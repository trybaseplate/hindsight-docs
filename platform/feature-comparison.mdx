## Overview
Feature Comparisons are technical deep-dives into competitor products that help understand your strengths and weaknesses. 
Instead of spending hours digging through documentation, debating with your product team, and taking notes - you can just use AI.

Best part? It stays up-to-date with new competitor releases.

These are commonly referred to as Harvey Ball charts.

## How it Works
Building Feature Comparisons is easy thanks to Hindsight's AI-Spreadsheet interface.

1. All you have to do is add a row for each feature you'd like to track, along with a description.
2. Select a row, then hit Regenerate. When a row runs, our AI will automatically pull in the relevant information and summarize it into a scorecard

### Editing Content
The data in the [overall comparison](https://app.usehindsight.com/comparison) is based on individual feature breakdowns, which you can edit for each competitor.
Just go to a competitor's page and click the "Features" tab. You can also click the "Edit" button on the comparison page.

## Sources
When building Feature Comparisons, Hindsight uses a few sources:
1. Public intel already indexed during daily research runs
2. Intel from your sales calls and deals
3. New intel from the web (e.g. specific pages from their documentation)

That means that Hindsight can fill in a Feature Comparisons with answers from new pages that haven't been seen before.
Those pages are then added to your CI database for future use, and cited for each answer.

### Customizing Sources
You can configure the sources that Hindsight uses to answer questions. For example, you can limit it to pages from a documentation site, or specific files.

## Best Practices
1. Create detailed descriptions. This is what our AI will use to understand what "4/4" vs. "2/4" support means. You should describe the critical aspects of each feature to get the best results.
2. Review answers. Get a product manager or engineer to review results with you to ensure you're getting the right information.
3. Configure sources. You can specify where our models look (e.g. only use documentation for answers)

## July 2025

### Assets (v1.8.0)
We introduced Chat-to-Asset creation so you can convert any AI chat response into a permanent, shareable document in your Library. Titles and optional competitor tags improve organization and discovery, while a markdown editor lets you refine content before sharing.

Assets integrate with Slack so teams can surface relevant materials in-channel, and a centralized Library makes search and access simple. Common use cases include battlecards, objection guides, product comparisons, one-pagers, and other sales collateral. See full notes: [/release-notes/assets](/release-notes/assets)

### Custom Answers (v1.8.0)
Custom Answers lets you define prompts once and automatically run them across all deals to fill qualitative data gaps. Answers can be true/false, one sentence, or paragraph length, and are derived from full deal context (CRM, transcripts, summaries, interviews). You can review, export, and optionally push answers to CRM.

This standardizes “free-form” insights like main objection, champion identified, decision maker, or coaching takeaways—enabling consistent analysis at scale. See full notes: [/release-notes/custom-answers](/release-notes/custom-answers)

### Custom Metrics (v1.9.0)
Create 1–5 scoring frameworks tailored to your business with rubrics, categories, and rules for when to score. Five enhanced default metrics (Sales Execution, Relationship, Pricing Fit, Product Fit, Competitive Performance) help you start fast, and scores come with explanations and manual overrides.

Metrics are visualized in Analytics with bar/line charts, multi-select comparisons, and segment filters, so you can spot trends, correlate with outcomes, and guide coaching. See full notes: [/release-notes/custom-metrics](/release-notes/custom-metrics)

### Decision Drivers Upgrade (v1.8.0)
We launched a pre-built library of decision drivers organized into six categories (Sales Execution, Relationship, Pricing & Packaging, Product & Features, Implementation & Support, Buyer Behavior). This makes setup dramatically faster, while retaining full customization and backward compatibility with existing drivers.

The new interface improves discovery, bulk selection, and organization, helping teams standardize definitions and improve analysis coverage. See full notes: [/release-notes/decision-drivers-2.0](/release-notes/decision-drivers-2.0)

### Feature Tracking 2.0 (v2.0.0)
A rebuilt feature tracking system adds a dedicated Features dashboard, AI-powered detection of feature mentions in deals, better analytics (mentions, sentiment, revenue impact), and improved competitive analysis with evidence-backed comparisons. Data is consolidated for performance and accuracy, with a cleaner UX and automatic migration for existing data.

The result is clearer visibility into which capabilities drive revenue, cleaner comparisons against competitors, and more actionable feedback loops for product and sales. See full notes: [/release-notes/feature-tracking-2.0](/release-notes/feature-tracking-2.0)

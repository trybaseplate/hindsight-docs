## Fill in Your Data Gaps with AI

Custom Answers lets you create a prompt once and automatically run it across all your deals. AI analyzes the complete deal context - including conversations, decision drivers, and outcomes - to generate consistent insights that help you understand patterns and fill gaps in your data.

## 🎯 What's New

**Create Custom Prompts**
Write questions you want answered about every deal. Prompts are fully customizable - they can be simple questions or more complex ones.
- "What was the main objection?"
- "Was a champion identified?" (True/False)
- "What coaching advice would help this rep?"

**Automatic Analysis**
AI runs your prompts against deal context including:
- CRM notes and fields
- Deal story and summaries
- Call transcripts and quotes
- Win/Loss Interviews

**Use Your Data**
- View and edit answers for any deal
- Export as part of a deal csv export
- Chat with your Deals using the AI Assistant
- Push answers to your CRM (available on Enterprise plans)

### Auto-suggested Drivers, Competitors, Features
We now automatically suggest new labels when AI analyzes deals, dramatically expanding your ability to track and analyze deal dynamics without manual configuration.

Key capabilities include:
- **Unlimited Labeling**: Track unlimited competitors, drivers, or features without pre-configuration
- **Smart Detection**: When new topics are detected in deals, we automatically create suggested tags (shown with lightbulb icons to accept/decline)
- **Expanded Competitive Intelligence**: Competitors can include insights on your team vs. DIY, homegrown, or other alternatives
- **Roadmap Integration**: Features can include both current capabilities and roadmap items, plus competitor capabilities
- **Enhanced Accuracy**: More labels provide more detailed insights and improved AI accuracy, as the system has less incentive to match weakly correlated quotes to existing labels

This feature eliminates the need for extensive upfront configuration while ensuring comprehensive deal analysis coverage.

### Trend Analysis
We added comprehensive trend analysis to help you understand how competitive dynamics, decision drivers, and feature importance evolve over time.

Features include:
- **Multi-timeframe Views**: Switch between 7-day, 30-day, 90-day, Year-to-Date, and All-time statistics
- **Visual Change Indicators**: Clear visual indicators showing changes and trends over time
- **Decision Driver Trends**: See how often specific decision drivers are cited in deals over time
- **Competitive Deal Volume and Win Rate Trends**: See how deal volume and win rates for competitors and drivers change over selected timeframes
- **Feature Mention Trends**: Track how often specific features are mentioned in deals over time

This enables teams to identify emerging patterns, seasonal trends, and long-term shifts in market dynamics.

### Decision Driver Table
We launched a dedicated Decision Drivers page (`/drivers`) for comprehensive driver management and analytics.

The new interface provides:
- **Centralized Driver Stats**: View performance metrics and usage statistics for all decision drivers
- **Driver Configuration**: Streamlined setup and management of custom decision drivers
- **Enhanced Organization**: Better categorization and bulk management tools for large driver libraries

This complements our existing Decision Drivers functionality with improved visibility and management capabilities.

### Reports (Beta)
We've graduated our Reports functionality from Alpha to Beta with significant improvements to the analysis engine and user experience. Reports now provide more sophisticated AI-powered insights and enhanced dataset customization options.

Key improvements include:
- **Enhanced AI Analysis**: Improved pattern recognition and insight generation with structured reporting templates
- **Advanced Dataset Builder**: More granular filtering options including custom properties, deal segments, and timeframe controls
- **Expanded Report Types**: Pre-built templates for win/loss analysis, competitive intelligence, product feedback, and sales execution
- **Report Management**: Complete reports library with saving, sharing, and collaboration features
- **CSV Export**: Download configured datasets for custom analysis in external tools
- **Conversational Follow-up**: Continue refining analysis through chat interface after report generation

The beta release supports analysis of up to 100 deals at once and includes comprehensive prompt customization for tailored business insights. See full documentation: [/platform/activate/custom-reports](/platform/activate/custom-reports)

## September 2025

### Competitive Intelligence Revamp
We refreshed our competitive tracking workflow to improve usability, controls, and human-in-the-loop processes. Key updates include:
- Ability to configure completely custom URL tracking for competitors. Track any webpage on a custom scraping schedule to meet your needs
- Improved event detection with AI, including deduplication of similar events and better extraction of event details
- New event triage workflow to review, edit, and approve detected events before they are shared with your team
- Slack notifications to alert competitor owners when new events are detected and ready for triage

### Chat with this Data (Beta)
We added an integrated chat experience built around the various data tables in Hindsight. This allows users to create custom .csv files with win/loss and competitive data,
then pass that data to Hindsight's AI assistant to answer questions, extract insights, and build reports.

### Reports (Alpha)
We released an early version of Hindsight's native Reports functionality. Reports allow users to use powerful, pre-built prompt templates to generate reports based on their deal data.
- 4 default reports released, spanning Win/Loss, Competitive Intel, Product, Marketing, and Sales topics
- Ability to customize report data by filtering to any custom criteria (e.g. region, product, time period)
- Completely customizable reports via prompting and further data exploration with help of AI assistant
- Reports library for creating, managing, and sharing reports across your Team

### RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)
We launched Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to help admins manage user permissions and data access. Members are assigned limited permissions to perform specific actions, while Admins have full access to all features and settings.

## August 2025

### Push to CRM (Beta)
We added Push to CRM functionality for Custom Answers and Custom Metrics, enabling automatic syncing of qualitative insights and scoring frameworks directly to your CRM. This ensures that critical deal information is consistently updated in your CRM, enhancing visibility and alignment across sales teams.

### Clari Copilot Integration
We launched a native integration with Clari Copilot, allowing seamless integration of Clari Copilot call transcripts with the Hindsight platform

### Outreach Kaia Integration
We launched an integration with Outreach Kaia call transcripts, enabling users to leverage Outreach Kaia's call transcripts and insights within the Hindsight platform.

### Chat with this Deal
We added an integrated chat window on individual deal reports, allowing users to interact with AI in the context of a specific deal without having to leave the page. This allows for simple queries and workflows built off of deal review data.


## July 2025

### Assets
We introduced Chat-to-Asset creation so you can convert any AI chat response into a permanent, shareable document in your Library. Titles and optional competitor tags improve organization and discovery, while a markdown editor lets you refine content before sharing.

Assets integrate with Slack so teams can surface relevant materials in-channel, and a centralized Library makes search and access simple. Common use cases include battlecards, objection guides, product comparisons, one-pagers, and other sales collateral. See full notes: [/release-notes/assets](/release-notes/assets)

### Custom Answers 
Custom Answers lets you define prompts once and automatically run them across all deals to fill qualitative data gaps. Answers can be true/false, one sentence, or paragraph length, and are derived from full deal context (CRM, transcripts, summaries, interviews). You can review, export, and optionally push answers to CRM.

This standardizes “free-form” insights like main objection, champion identified, decision maker, or coaching takeaways—enabling consistent analysis at scale. See full notes: [/release-notes/custom-answers](/release-notes/custom-answers)

### Custom Metrics
Create 1–5 scoring frameworks tailored to your business with rubrics, categories, and rules for when to score. Five enhanced default metrics (Sales Execution, Relationship, Pricing Fit, Product Fit, Competitive Performance) help you start fast, and scores come with explanations and manual overrides.

Metrics are visualized in Analytics with bar/line charts, multi-select comparisons, and segment filters, so you can spot trends, correlate with outcomes, and guide coaching. See full notes: [/release-notes/custom-metrics](/release-notes/custom-metrics)

### Decision Drivers Upgrade
We launched a pre-built library of decision drivers organized into six categories (Sales Execution, Relationship, Pricing & Packaging, Product & Features, Implementation & Support, Buyer Behavior). This makes setup dramatically faster, while retaining full customization and backward compatibility with existing drivers.

The new interface improves discovery, bulk selection, and organization, helping teams standardize definitions and improve analysis coverage. See full notes: [/release-notes/decision-drivers-2.0](/release-notes/decision-drivers-2.0)

### Feature Tracking 2.0
A rebuilt feature tracking system adds a dedicated Features dashboard, AI-powered detection of feature mentions in deals, better analytics (mentions, sentiment, revenue impact), and improved competitive analysis with evidence-backed comparisons. Data is consolidated for performance and accuracy, with a cleaner UX and automatic migration for existing data.

The result is clearer visibility into which capabilities drive revenue, cleaner comparisons against competitors, and more actionable feedback loops for product and sales. See full notes: [/release-notes/feature-tracking-2.0](/release-notes/feature-tracking-2.0)

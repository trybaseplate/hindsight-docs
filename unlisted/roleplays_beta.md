# Roleplays Beta

> **Early Access Feature**: This feature is in beta and available to select design partners. We're actively gathering feedback to improve the experience.

## Overview

Roleplays helps your sales team practice handling real sales conversations and responding to objections using best practices from your actual deals. Using AI-powered conversations, reps engage in realistic dialogues with a simulated buyer in a video call environment with real-time audio. The AI responds dynamically to what your reps say, creating authentic back-and-forth conversations that mirror real sales calls.

Currently focused on competitive scenarios, this feature allows managers to create realistic practice sessions that reps can complete on their own time, with automatic grading and feedback.

## What's the point?

Sales conversations, especially competitive ones, require practice to master. It doesn't matter if you have a great battlecard but nobody uses it. Roleplays allows your team to:

- **Practice in a safe environment** - Make mistakes and learn without risking real deals
- **Experience realistic conversations** - AI responds in real-time based on what reps say, just like a real buyer would
- **Scale coaching** - Managers can create one roleplay that hundreds of reps can use
- **Learn from real scenarios** - Scenarios are based on actual competitive situations from your deals
- **Get instant feedback** - Automated grading helps reps understand what they did well and where to improve

## Getting Started

### 1. Design Your Roleplay

Start by setting up the basics of your roleplay scenario:

- **Avatar**: Choose or customize the persona your reps will interact with (e.g., "Sarah Smith, Head of Engineering at Spotify")
- **Scenario**: Define the competitive situation and context (e.g., "This is a discovery call. Sarah has previously been on a call with Hooli so we don't have first stab at this. She booked a call from our landing page and we don't have a strong relationship yet.")
- **Goals**: Set clear objectives for what the rep should accomplish in the conversation (e.g. "Lay some landmines and position us as the trusted vendor. Book a demo with clear next steps before leaving the call.")

### 2. Select Base Deals

Ground your roleplay in reality by selecting deals to base the scenario on:

- Choose relevant deals that match your competitive scenario
- The system will use real objections, questions, and competitive dynamics from these deals
- This ensures the roleplay reflects actual situations your team faces

### 3. Generate and Edit the Rubric

The rubric determines how reps will be evaluated:

- **Generate**: Use our AI to create an initial rubric based on your scenario and selected deals
- **Edit**: Customize the grading criteria to match your team's best practices
- Define what "good" looks like for each aspect of the conversation

### 4. Share and Track

Once your roleplay is ready:

- **Send the link** to your reps - They can complete it at their convenience
- **Reps join a simulated video call** - They'll see and hear the AI buyer in a realistic call environment
- **AI responds in real-time** - The conversation flows naturally based on what your rep says
- **Review results** - All sessions are automatically saved and graded
- **Identify coaching opportunities** - See where reps excel and where they need help

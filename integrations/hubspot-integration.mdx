## Overview
Hindsight connects to HubSpot via OAuth to sync your deals and analyze them for competitive win-loss insights. This guide will help you set up the integration and start using it effectively.

### How it Works
When you connect Hindsight to your HubSpot CRM, you'll be able to **import specific Deals into Hindsight**. Hindsight will analyze these Deals to extract competitive insights based on your decision drivers.
<br></br><br></br>You can set up **automation rules** in Hindsight that automatically import Deals based on custom criteria. You can use your HubSpot data to **filter in the Win-Loss dashboard** and analyze your Deals based on specific criteria, such as stage, amount, or close date.

### Daily Sync
**Opportunties are synced for the latest data every 12 hours**. This means that any changes made to your Deals in HubSpot will be reflected in Hindsight automatically.
Hindsight listens to Deals via webhooks to make this seamless for users.

### Supported Objects
Hindsight only syncs objects associated with the Deals that you import. This includes:
- Deals
- Account
- Products
- Contacts
- Custom Fields
- Notes
- Emails
- Meetings
- Tickets

### Segments
**You can configure [segments](https://app.usehindsight.com/settings/segments) in Hindsight to filter your Deals based on custom criteria.** This allows you to analyze specific subsets of your Deals, such as those with a certain stage, amount, or close date.
Segments are useful for analyzing your Deals based on specific criteria, such as:
- Deals with a certain stage or pipeline (e.g. "Closed Won, New Business")
- Deals with a certain amount (e.g. "> $10,000")
- Deals with a certain close date (e.g. "Next 30 days")
- Deals with a certain account type (e.g. "Enterprise")
- Deals with a certain product (e.g. "Product A")
- Deals with a certain region (e.g. "North America")

## Connecting HubSpot
### Authorization
**Authorizing HubSpot requires admin access to your HubSpot account.** Click "Connect" on the [integrations](https://app.usehindsight.com/settings/integrations) page and follow the authorization steps.
This will redirect you to the HubSpot authorization page. Click "Allow" to authorize Hindsight to access your HubSpot account. If you're having issues, contact your HubSpot admin.

### Import Rules
Setting up import rules allows you to **automatically import Deals into Hindsight** based on custom criteria. This is useful for keeping Hindsight's insights up-to-date without manual intervention.
We recommend filtering to Closed Won and Lost Deals. You can also filter by custom fields, such as "Region" or "Product", to analyze specific subsets of your Deals.

## Customization

### Deals Stages
To help Hindsight understand your custom Deals stages, navigate to the [CRM Settings](https://app.usehindsight.com/settings/properties) and click the "Stages" tab.
**Mark your custom Deals stages as "Closed Won" or "Closed Lost"** to help Hindsight analyze your Deals correctly. This will allow Hindsight to tag your Deals with the correct status and provide accurate win-loss insights.

### Custom Properties
You can customize the properties that Hindsight uses to analyze your Deals in [CRM Settings](https://app.usehindsight.com/settings/properties) on the "Deals" and "Accounts". Having more properties makes analysis and sync slower, so "turn off"
You can map your custom properties to Hindsight's default properties like "Region", "Type", and "Amount". Properties that are "Synced" but not mapped to a Hindsight property will still be analyzed and available for filtering.

### Line Items
Hindsight pulls in your [line items](https://app.usehindsight.com/settings/products) from HubSpot to analyze your Deals. This allows Hindsight to provide insights on specific products and services associated with your Deals.

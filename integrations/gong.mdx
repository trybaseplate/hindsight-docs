### Overview
Hindsight integrates with Gong to extract Competitive Win-Loss Insights from your calls with prospects.
These insights are then used in battlecards, reports, and more.

### How it Works
<img alt="Deal Home" classname="block" src="/images/deals-home.png" />

1. When Deals are imported to Hindsight (usually via Salesforce or HubSpot integration), Hindsight will find the matching calls in Gong and import them to the right deal.
2. This relies on the integration between Gong and your CRM for matching, and as a fallback, the contact's email.
3. Hindsight will then analyze the calls and extract Competitive Win-Loss Insights using AI.
4. These insights are then used to update your Competitive Intelligence database, and can be used in battlecards, reports, and more.

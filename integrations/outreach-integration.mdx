## Overview
Hindsight integrates with Outreach Kaia to extract Competitive Win-Loss Insights from your call recordings and transcripts. Since Outreach doesn't provide direct API access to Kaia transcripts, this integration uses Outreach's daily S3 export feature to securely transfer your call data to Hindsight.

For support, please reach out via your Slack Connect channel or via [email](mailto:support@usehindsight.com)

### How it Works
1. **Daily Export**: Outreach automatically exports your Kaia call recordings and transcripts to your AWS S3 bucket every day
2. **Secure Access**: Hindsight securely accesses your S3 bucket using the credentials you provide
3. **Smart Matching**: Hindsight automatically matches call transcripts to the right deals based on participant emails, account domains, and call timing
4. **AI Analysis**: Hindsight analyzes the call transcripts to extract competitive insights and decision drivers
5. **Deal Integration**: Insights are automatically added to your deals and used in battlecards, reports, and competitive intelligence

## Setup Requirements

### Prerequisites
- **Outreach Admin Access**: You need admin access to configure the daily export feature
- **AWS Account**: You need an AWS account to create the S3 bucket
- **Growth Plan**: Outreach integration requires a Hindsight Enterprise plan

### Setup Overview
This setup involves three main steps:
1. **Create AWS S3 Bucket** - Set up a dedicated bucket for Outreach exports
2. **Configure Outreach Export** - Enable daily export to your S3 bucket  
3. **Connect to Hindsight** - Provide S3 credentials to Hindsight

## Step 1: Create AWS S3 Bucket

### 1.1 Create the S3 Bucket
1. Log into your [AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/)
2. Navigate to **S3** service
3. Click **"Create bucket"**
4. Configure your bucket:
   - **Bucket name**: `your-company-outreach-kaia` (choose a unique name)
   - **AWS Region**: Choose a region close to your location
   - **Block Public Access**: Keep all public access blocked (recommended)
   - **Bucket Versioning**: Enable (recommended)
   - **Default encryption**: Enable with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3)

<img alt="S3 Bucket Creation" classname="block" src="/images/outreach/s3-bucket-create.png" />

5. Click **"Create bucket"**

### 1.2 Create IAM User for Hindsight
1. Navigate to **IAM** service in AWS Console
2. Click **"Users"** in the left sidebar
3. Click **"Add users"**
4. Configure the user:
   - **User name**: `hindsight-outreach-access`
   - **Access type**: Select **"Access key - Programmatic access"**

<img alt="IAM User Creation" classname="block" src="/images/outreach/iam-user-create.png" />

5. Click **"Next: Permissions"**

### 1.3 Create IAM Policy
1. Click **"Attach policies directly"**
2. Click **"Create policy"**
3. Switch to the **JSON** tab and paste this policy:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:ListBucket",
        "s3:DeleteObject"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::your-company-outreach-kaia",
        "arn:aws:s3:::your-company-outreach-kaia/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

<img alt="IAM Policy JSON" classname="block" src="/images/outreach/iam-policy-json.png" />

⚠️ **Important**: Replace `your-company-outreach-kaia` with your actual bucket name

4. Click **"Next: Tags"** (optional)
5. Click **"Next: Review"**
6. Name your policy: `HindsightOutreachS3Access`
7. Click **"Create policy"**

### 1.4 Attach Policy to User
1. Go back to the user creation tab
2. Search for `HindsightOutreachS3Access` and select it
3. Click **"Next: Tags"** (optional)
4. Click **"Next: Review"**
5. Click **"Create user"**

### 1.5 Save Access Keys
**Important**: Save these credentials securely - you'll need them for Hindsight configuration.

<img alt="IAM Access Keys" classname="block" src="/images/outreach/iam-access-keys.png" />

- **Access Key ID**: `AKIA...` 
- **Secret Access Key**: `wJalrXUt...` (click "Show" to reveal)

⚠️ **Security Note**: These keys provide access to your S3 bucket. Store them securely and never share them publicly.

## Verification & Usage

### Daily Sync Process
Once configured, the integration works automatically:

1. **Outreach Export**: Every day, Outreach exports new Kaia recordings to your S3 bucket
2. **Hindsight Sync**: During your regular Salesforce/HubSpot deal syncs, Hindsight checks for new call transcripts
3. **Automatic Matching**: Hindsight matches calls to deals based on:
   - Participant email addresses
   - Account domains
   - Call timing relative to deal dates
   - Outreach user assignments

<img alt="Sync Status" classname="block" src="/images/outreach/sync-status.png" />

### Monitoring Integration Health
Check integration status on the [Integrations page](https://app.usehindsight.com/settings/integrations):

- **Connection Status**: Shows if Outreach and S3 are connected
- **Last Sync**: When Hindsight last processed new files
- **Files Processed**: Number of transcripts processed today
- **Transcripts Matched**: How many were successfully matched to deals

### Viewing Call Transcripts in Deals
Once calls are matched to deals, you'll see them in:

1. **Deal Documents**: Call transcripts appear as documents in your deals
2. **Competitive Insights**: AI-extracted insights from calls
3. **Battlecards**: Competitive intelligence from your calls

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "S3 Access Denied" Error
- **Cause**: Incorrect IAM permissions or access keys
- **Solution**: 
  1. Verify your S3 bucket name matches exactly
  2. Check IAM policy has correct bucket ARN
  3. Ensure access keys are entered correctly
  4. Test S3 access from AWS Console

#### "No Files Found" 
- **Cause**: Outreach export not working or no calls in timeframe
- **Solution**:
  1. Check Outreach export status in admin panel
  2. Verify calls exist in the expected timeframe
  3. Wait 24-48 hours for initial export to complete

#### "Low Match Rate"
- **Cause**: Calls not matching to deals properly
- **Solution**:
  1. Ensure deal contact emails match call participants
  2. Check deal date ranges include call timestamps
  3. Verify Outreach users are mapped correctly

### Getting Help

## Security & Privacy

### Data Security
- **Encryption**: All data is encrypted in transit and at rest
- **Access Control**: IAM policies limit Hindsight's access to only necessary S3 operations
- **Audit Trail**: All S3 access is logged in AWS CloudTrail

### Data Processing
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Processed files are automatically deleted from S3 (configurable)
- **Data Retention**: Transcripts are stored according to your Hindsight data retention policy
- **Privacy**: Only users with deal access can view associated call transcripts

### Compliance
This integration supports:
- **SOC 2 Type II** compliance
- **GDPR** data protection requirements
- **CCPA** privacy regulations

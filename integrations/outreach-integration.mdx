## Overview
Hindsight integrates with Outreach Kaia to extract Competitive Win-Loss Insights from your call recordings and transcripts. Since Outreach doesn't provide direct API access to Kaia transcripts, this integration uses Outreach's daily S3 export feature to securely transfer your call data to Hindsight.

The main steps:
1. Set up an AWS S3 bucket to recieve Outreach Kaia exports (follow this guide)
2. Configure Outreach to export Kaia recordings to your S3 bucket daily [see Outreach docs](https://support.outreach.io/hc/en-us/articles/28005562346395-Exporting-Data-in-Kaia-using-Daily-Export)
3. Connect Hindsight to your Outreach account and S3 bucket using the steps below (detailed instructions follow)

For support, please reach out via your Slack Connect channel or via [email](mailto:support@usehindsight.com)

### How it Works
1. **Daily Export**: Outreach automatically exports your Kaia call recordings and transcripts to your AWS S3 bucket every day
2. **Secure Access**: Hindsight securely accesses your S3 bucket using the credentials you provide
3. **Smart Matching**: Hindsight automatically matches call transcripts to the right deals based on participant emails, account domains, and call timing
4. **AI Analysis**: Hindsight analyzes the call transcripts to extract competitive insights and decision drivers
5. **Deal Integration**: Insights are automatically added to your deals and used in battlecards, reports, and competitive intelligence

## Setup Requirements

### Prerequisites
- **Outreach Admin Access**: You need admin access to configure the daily export feature
- **AWS Account**: You need an AWS account to create the S3 bucket
- **Growth Plan**: Outreach integration requires a Hindsight Enterprise plan

### Setup Overview
This setup involves three main steps:
1. **Create AWS S3 Bucket** - Set up a dedicated bucket for Outreach exports
2. **Configure Outreach Export** - Enable daily export to your S3 bucket  
3. **Connect to Hindsight** - Provide S3 credentials to Hindsight

---

## Step 1: Create AWS S3 Bucket

### 1.1 Create the S3 Bucket
1. Log into your [AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/)
2. Navigate to **S3** service
3. Click **"Create bucket"**
4. Configure your bucket:
   - **Bucket name**: `your-company-outreach-kaia` (choose a unique name)
   - **AWS Region**: Choose a region close to your location
   - **Block Public Access**: Keep all public access blocked (recommended)
   - **Bucket Versioning**: Enable (recommended)
   - **Default encryption**: Enable with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3)
5. Click **"Create bucket"**

### 1.2 Create IAM User for Hindsight
1. Navigate to **IAM** service in AWS Console
2. Click **"Users"** in the left sidebar
3. Click **"Create user"** 
4. Configure the user:
   - **User name**: `hindsight-outreach-access`
   - Leave **"Provide user access to the AWS Management Console"** **unchecked** - we only need programmatic access
5. Click **"Next"**

### 1.3 Create and Attach IAM Policy

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: The next steps involve creating a policy in a new tab, then returning to attach it. Keep both tabs open!

1. Click **"Attach policies directly"**
2. Click **"Create policy"** 

   ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: This opens a new browser tab - **do not close your user creation tab!**

3. **In the new policy tab**, switch to the **JSON** tab
4. **Delete all existing content** and paste this policy:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:ListBucket",
        "s3:DeleteObject",
        "s3:PutObject"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::your-company-outreach-kaia",
        "arn:aws:s3:::your-company-outreach-kaia/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Replace `your-company-outreach-kaia` with your actual bucket name

5. **In the policy tab**, click **"Next: Tags"** (optional)
6. **In the policy tab**, click **"Next: Review"**
7. **In the policy tab**, name your policy: `HindsightOutreachS3Access`
8. **In the policy tab**, click **"Create policy"**
9. **Close the policy tab** and **return to your user creation tab**

### 1.4 Attach the Policy to Your User

**Back in your user creation tab:**

1. Click the **refresh button** (üîÑ) next to the search box to load your new policy
2. In the search box, type: `HindsightOutreachS3Access`
3. **Check the checkbox** next to `HindsightOutreachS3Access` to select it
4. Click **"Next: Tags"** (optional)
5. Click **"Next: Review"**
6. Click **"Create user"**

### 1.5 Create Access Keys

After creating the user, you'll be taken to the user details page. Now you need to create access keys:

1. Click the **"Create access key"** button
2. Select **"Application running outside AWS"** as the use case
3. Click **"Next"**
4. Add a description tag (optional): `Hindsight S3 Integration`
5. Click **"Create access key"**

**What we're creating**: These are **programmatic access keys** (not console login credentials) that allow Hindsight to authenticate with AWS APIs to access your S3 bucket.

**Copy and save these values immediately**:
- **Access Key ID**: Starts with `AKIA...` (e.g., `AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE`)
- **Secret Access Key**: Long alphanumeric string (click **"Show"** to reveal, e.g., `wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY`)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Critical**: AWS will **never show the Secret Access Key again** after you close this page. If you lose it, you'll need to create new access keys.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Security Note**: These keys provide programmatic access to your S3 bucket. Store them securely (like in a password manager) and never share them publicly or commit them to code repositories.

## Verification & Usage

### Daily Sync Process
Once configured, the integration works automatically:

1. **Outreach Export**: Every day, Outreach exports new Kaia recordings to your S3 bucket
2. **Hindsight Sync**: During your regular Salesforce/HubSpot deal syncs, Hindsight checks for new call transcripts
3. **Automatic Matching**: Hindsight matches calls to deals based on:
   - Participant email addresses
   - Account domains
   - Call timing relative to deal dates
   - Outreach user assignments

### Monitoring Integration Health
Check integration status on the [Integrations page](https://app.usehindsight.com/settings/integrations):

- **Connection Status**: Shows if Outreach and S3 are connected
- **Last Sync**: When Hindsight last processed new files
- **Files Processed**: Number of transcripts processed today
- **Transcripts Matched**: How many were successfully matched to deals

### Viewing Call Transcripts in Deals
Once calls are matched to deals, you'll see them in:

1. **Deal Documents**: Call transcripts appear as documents in your deals
2. **Competitive Insights**: AI-extracted insights from calls
3. **Battlecards**: Competitive intelligence from your calls

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "S3 Access Denied" Error
- **Cause**: Incorrect IAM permissions or access keys
- **Solution**: 
  1. Verify your S3 bucket name matches exactly
  2. Check IAM policy has correct bucket ARN
  3. Ensure access keys are entered correctly
  4. Test S3 access from AWS Console

#### "No Files Found" 
- **Cause**: Outreach export not working or no calls in timeframe
- **Solution**:
  1. Check Outreach export status in admin panel
  2. Verify calls exist in the expected timeframe
  3. Wait 24-48 hours for initial export to complete

#### "Low Match Rate"
- **Cause**: Calls not matching to deals properly
- **Solution**:
  1. Ensure deal contact emails match call participants
  2. Check deal date ranges include call timestamps
  3. Verify Outreach users are mapped correctly

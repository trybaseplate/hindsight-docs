### Configure Hindsight
To get started, let's customize Hindsight so your competitive win-loss insights are tailored for your business.

<img alt="Competitors" classname="block" src="/images/competitors.png" />


<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion icon="book" title="Add Your Pricing and Product Details">
  Hindsight uses information about your products and pricing to build relevant competitor battlecards.
  If you have documents or webpages that overview your pricing and products, upload that content to your [Knowledge Base](https://app.usehindsight.com/library/knowledge).
  When creating battlecards, our AI will use this information to help you understand how your competitors stack up against you.
  <img alt="Knowledge Base" classname="block" src="/images/knowledge-base-upload.png" />
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="globe-pointer" title="Add Competitors">
   Add your [competitors](https://app.usehindsight.com/competitors) by URL. You can also add specific instructions for our AI agents to follow when tracking your competitors. For example, you can tell them to only track content about specific products, specific subdomain, or even specific keywords.
    <img alt="Competitors" classname="block" src="/images/competitors-add.png" />
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="tags" title="Add Decision Drivers">
    Decision drivers are the key factors that influence your customers' buying decisions. These can include pricing, specific features, customer support, and more. By adding decision drivers, you can help our AI agents understand what to look for when analyzing your deals.
    You can add decision drivers by going to the [Decision Drivers](https://app.usehindsight.com/settings/reasons) page and clicking "New Driver". Add a detailed description of the driver and any relevant keywords. Our AI will use this information to help you understand your strengths and weaknesses compared to your competitors.

### Connect Your Sales Tools
Next, let's connect a few [integrations](https://app.usehindsight.com/settings/integrations). Hindsight analyzes your sales data to tag competitors, extract competitive insights, and generate battlecards.
These insights are critical for building battlecards that help your sales team win more deals.

<img alt="Integrations" classname="block" src="/images/integrations.png" />

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion icon="salesforce" title="Connect Your CRM">
  Connect your Salesforce or HubSpot account vai OAuth. This will require admin access to your CRM. You can set up automation rules to automatically import your deals. Visit the [CRM settings](https://app.usehindsight.com/settings/properties) page for further controls. For detailed CRM setup instructions, check out our [CRM integration guide](https://docs.usehindsight.com/essentials/crm-integration).

<Accordion icon="microphone" title="Connect Your Meeting Notetaker">

You can use our [Zapier](https://docs.usehindsight.com/guides/zapier) integration to connect meeting notetakers that aren't natively supported.

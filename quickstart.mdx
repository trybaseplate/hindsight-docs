{/* ### Connect Your Sales Tools
Next, let's connect a few [integrations](https://app.usehindsight.com/settings/integrations). Hindsight analyzes your sales data to tag competitors, extract competitive insights, and generate battlecards.
These insights are critical for building battlecards that help your sales team win more deals.
 Decision drivers are the key factors that influence your customers' buying decisions. These can include pricing, specific features, customer support, and more. By adding decision drivers, you can help our AI agents understand what to look for when analyzing your deals.
    You can add decision drivers by going to the [Decision Drivers](https://app.usehindsight.com/settings/reasons) page and clicking "New Driver". Add a detailed description of the driver and any relevant keywords. Our AI will use this information to help you understand your strengths and weaknesses compared to your competitors.

### Add Competitors
To get started, let's add some [competitors](https://app.usehindsight.com/competitors). Once you tell us who you're competitors are, our AI agents will automatically start finding relevant content from their websites and other places on the internet to track.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion icon="book" title="Add Your Pricing and Product Details">
  Hindsight uses information about your products and pricing to build relevant competitor battlecards.
  If you have documents or webpages that overview your pricing and products, upload that content to your [Knowledge Base](https://app.usehindsight.com/library/knowledge).
  When creating battlecards, our AI will use this information to help you understand how your competitors stack up against you.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="globe-pointer" title="Add Competitors">
   Add your competitors by URL. You can also add specific instructions for our AI agents to follow when tracking your competitors. For example, you can tell them to only track content about specific products, specific subdomain, or even specific keywords.

### Connect Your Sales Tools
Next, let's connect a few [integrations](https://app.usehindsight.com/settings/integrations). Hindsight analyzes your sales data to tag competitors, extract competitive insights, and generate battlecards.
These insights are critical for building battlecards that help your sales team win more deals.

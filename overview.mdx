## The Win-Loss Data Problem

Most teams struggle with a fundamental challenge: **bad win-loss data**. 

You might be relying on your sales reps to pick win-loss reasons from dropdown menus, or write out their own analysis after a deal closes.
You might be doing in depth deal reviews and interviews, but only for a small percentage of deals due to time constraints.

The result? Win-loss data that is incomplete, biased, and ultimately non-actionable.

**Yet win-loss data is some of the most important information your organization collects.** It reveals exactly what's driving revenue success and what's holding you back. This data should be treated with the same rigor as your financial metrics - because it directly impacts them.

## The Win-Loss Opportunity

**Good win-loss analysis systematically improves win rates and grows revenue** by identifying:
- ✅ **What to double down on**: Your competitive advantages and successful patterns
- ❌ **What's holding you back**: Process gaps, competitive weaknesses, and improvement opportunities

This data is the foundation for strategic decision-making, and continuous improvement across product, pricing, marketing, and sales execution.

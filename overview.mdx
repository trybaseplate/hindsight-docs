## Winning more starts with knowing why you lose.

Hindsight analyzes every deal to identify ways to increase your win rate, then turns those insights into actionable battlecards, coaching, and reports.

## The Problem

GTM teams lack real insight into why they win and lose deals:

- **Inaccurate data**: Reps manually input win-loss reasons, leading to biased and incomplete information
- **Stale competitive intel**: Keeping battlecards and positioning current requires constant vigilance and manual work
- **Slow time-to-insight**: Identifying trends means reviewing calls, emails, and deals one by one—things slip through
- **Disconnected teams**: Product, sales, marketing, and enablement lack a shared view of what's impacting deals

The result? Missed opportunities to improve, competitive content that goes unused, and strategic decisions made without real data.

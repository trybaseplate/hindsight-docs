Recipes let you create custom workflows in Hindsight which you can schedule or run on demand. When you cook up something that works, save it as a recipe!

## What Can You Create?

Recipes power a wide range of use cases built on top of Hindsight's Deal Intelligence.

- **Win/loss reports and deal alerts in Slack** — Recurring reports on deal outcomes and trends
- **Personalized sales coaching and insights** — Coaching insights, talk tracks, and rep performance analysis
- **Competitive assets that auto-update** — Battlecards, objection handling guides, and competitor comparisons
- **Real-time product intelligence** — Feature gap reports, buyer feedback summaries, and roadmap inputs

## Automating with Workflows (Early Access)

Once you've built a recipe, you can schedule it to run automatically with **Workflows**. This lets you:

- **Schedule recurring runs** — Set recipes to run daily, weekly, or on a custom cadence
- **Deliver to Slack** — Push insights directly to specific Slack channels, or Slack DMs
- **Send via email** — Share reports with groups of stakeholders in a newsletter format
- **Save to Library** - Create or update existing assets and documents in your Library
- **Connect external tools** — Use Zapier to send outputs to your CRM, docs, or other systems

Workflows turn one-time analysis into ongoing intelligence that reaches your team where they work.

## Recipe Library

We provide a growing library of pre-built recipes to get you started. These cover common use cases across departments:

- **Competitive Intel** — Battlecards, competitor comparisons, and win/loss analysis by competitor
- **Enablement** — Coaching insights, objection handling, and talk tracks
- **Marketing** — Messaging analysis, persona insights, and competitive trends
- **Operations** — Pipeline trends, pricing insights, and process optimization
- **Product** — Feature gap reports, buyer feedback, and roadmap inputs
- **Sales** — Deal reviews, rep performance, and win-loss reports

<Tip>
Use a default recipe as a starting point—hit the **Remix** button and edit it to make your own.

## Recipe Types

### AI Search Recipes
Use natural language prompts to search and analyze your deal data. These recipes leverage Hindsight's AI search capabilities to find insights across your deals.

AI Search Recipes are best for qualitative insights that can be derived by diving deeper into a smaller set of deals. Use cases include:
- Finding objections from the last week of calls
- Summarizing competitive positioning in recent deals
- Extracting buyer personas from a set of closed-won deals

When building AI Search recipes, keep in mind the 25-deal context window for individual tool calls. Make sure your prompt is focused enough to get meaningful results from a limited set of deals.

For more on crafting effective prompts in AI Search Mode, see the [Good Prompts](/guides/prompting) guide.

### Data Analyst Mode Recipes
Data Analyst mode allows Hindsight's AI to pick apart trends from across an unlimited number of deals, without being limited to the 25-deal context window of AI Search mode.

Data Analyst mode pulls data directly from Hindsight's Deal Reviews, and uses Code Interpreter to segment, chart, and analyze large datasets.

To provide fine-grained controls, Data Analyst mode allows you to define your dataset using a set of "Filters" and "Columns".
- **Filters** — Define which deals to include in the analysis using CRM or Hindsight-defined field. E.g. "Stage is 'Closed Won'" or "Industry is 'Healthcare'"
- **Columns** — Select the data fields to analyze e.g. "Account.Industry", "Deal.Product_Fit", "Deal.Loss_Reason" 

## Variables

Variables make your recipes dynamic and reusable. When someone runs a recipe, they'll see a form to fill in the required inputs.

### Variable Types

- **Text variables** — Inserted directly into your prompt. Use these for things like competitor names, product features, or custom instructions.
- **Deal filter variables** — Map to specific filters in Data Analyst mode. Use these to let users select deal stages, date ranges, segments, or other filter criteria at runtime.

### Required vs Optional

- **Required variables** — Must be filled in before the recipe can run
- **Optional variables** — Provide defaults or allow users to skip if not needed


## Creating a Recipe

1. Navigate to **Chat** in Hindsight
2. Click **Browse Recipes**
3. Choose an existing recipe to remix, or click **Create Recipe**
4. Configure your inputs and hit Run to test

## Best Practices

- **Keep prompts focused** — Each recipe should solve one specific problem
- **Use clear variable names** — Make it obvious what inputs are expected
- **Test your recipe** — Run your recipe before sharing with the team
- **Document your recipes** — Add descriptions so teammates understand when to use each one

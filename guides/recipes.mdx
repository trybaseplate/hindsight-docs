Recipes let you create reusable workflows in Hindsight that your entire team can leverage. Define the inputs, prompts, and analysis parameters once—then run them repeatedly with different data.

## What Can You Create?

Recipes power a wide range of use cases across your go-to-market team:

- **Competitive assets that auto-update** — Battlecards, objection handling guides, and competitor comparisons
- **Win/loss reports and deal alerts in Slack** — Recurring reports on deal outcomes and trends
- **Personalized sales coaching and insights** — Coaching insights, talk tracks, and rep performance analysis
- **Real-time product intelligence** — Feature gap reports, buyer feedback summaries, and roadmap inputs

## Automating with Workflows (Early Access)

Once you've built a recipe, you can schedule it to run automatically with **Workflows**. This lets you:

- **Schedule recurring runs** — Set recipes to run daily, weekly, or on a custom cadence
- **Deliver to Slack** — Push insights directly to specific Slack channels
- **Send via email** — Share reports with stakeholders automatically
- **Connect external tools** — Use Zapier to send outputs to your CRM, docs, or other systems

Workflows turn one-time analysis into ongoing intelligence that reaches your team where they work.

## Recipe Library

Hindsight provides a variety of default AI Search and Data Analyst recipes across key use cases:

- **Competitive Intel** — Battlecards, competitor comparisons, and win/loss analysis by competitor
- **Enablement** — Coaching insights, objection handling, and talk tracks
- **Marketing** — Messaging analysis, persona insights, and competitive trends
- **Operations** — Pipeline trends, pricing insights, and process optimization
- **Product** — Feature gap reports, buyer feedback, and roadmap inputs
- **Sales** — Deal reviews, rep performance, and win-loss reports

<Tip>
Use a default recipe as a starting point—hit the **Remix** button and edit it to make your own.

## Recipe Types

### AI Search Recipes
Use natural language prompts to search and analyze your deal data. These recipes leverage Hindsight's AI search capabilities to find insights across your deals.

For more on crafting effective prompts in AI Search Mode, see the [Good Prompts](/guides/prompting) guide.

### Data Analyst Mode Recipes
Data Analyst mode allows Hindsight's AI to pick apart trends from across an unlimited number of deals, without being limited to the 25-deal context window of AI Search mode.

Data Analyst mode pulls data directly from Hindsight's Deal Reviews, and uses a code writing Agent to segment, chart, and analyze large datasets.

To provide fine-grained controls, Data Analyst mode allows you to define your dataset using a set of "Filters" and "Columns".
- **Filters** — Define which deals to include in the analysis using CRM or Hindsight-defined field. E.g. "Stage is 'Closed Won'" or "Industry is 'Healthcare'"
- **Columns** — Select the data fields to analyze e.g. "Account.Industry", "Deal.Product_Fit", "Deal.Loss_Reason" 

## Variables

Variables make your recipes dynamic and reusable. When someone runs a recipe, they'll see a form to fill in the required inputs.

### Variable Types

- **Text variables** — Inserted directly into your prompt. Use these for things like competitor names, product features, or custom instructions.
- **Deal filter variables** — Map to specific filters in Data Analyst mode. Use these to let users select deal stages, date ranges, segments, or other filter criteria at runtime.

### Required vs Optional

- **Required variables** — Must be filled in before the recipe can run
- **Optional variables** — Provide defaults or allow users to skip if not needed


## Creating a Recipe

1. Navigate to **Chat** in Hindsight
2. Click **Browse Recipes**
3. Choose an existing recipe to remix, or click **Create Recipe**
4. Configure your inputs and hit Run to test

## Best Practices

- **Keep prompts focused** — Each recipe should solve one specific problem
- **Use clear variable names** — Make it obvious what inputs are expected
- **Test your recipe** — Run your recipe before sharing with the team
- **Document your recipes** — Add descriptions so teammates understand when to use each one

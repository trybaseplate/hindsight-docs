## Why this Matters
The main challenge to creating helpful, accurate AI is getting the right context into the model's attention span at the right time.
The process of doing this is called "context engineering."

Hindsight's makes finding the right context easy by abstracting away complicated research tasks (like finding objections vs. competitor Acme in lost deals from this quarter) behind "tools" that you can invoke via natural language.

Simple, non descript queries still work for most use cases (e.g. what's the top reason we lose to competitor X) - our AI will plan it's response and pick the right tools to use.

However, by understanding what tools Hindsight has access to, you can be more clear about the task and steps, allowing you to complete more complex tasks with more precision.
If you aren't comfortable invoking specific tools in your prompt, feel free to use Recipes for powerful pre-built prompts (see the [Recipe Guide](/guides/recipes) for more).

## Agent Routing
Behind the scenes, Hindsight routes your queries to specialized sub-agents, each optimized for different tasks. The system automatically detects whether you're asking about competitors, deals, or data analysis and picks the right expert to handle your request.

## Tools

### Deal Research
- **Select Deals** — use filters to select deals by name, segment, stage, competitor, amount, close date.
- **Search Deals** — find deals based on keywords or themes in the deal analysis data using semantic search.
- **Search Across Deal Documents** — broad scan across deal documents (e.g. transcripts) for themes and examples (e.g. GDPR).
- **Search Within Deal** — deep search inside specific deals' transcripts, CRM fields, and notes.

### Competitive Intelligence
- **Competitor Assets** — search approved messaging, battlecards, and competitive assets for a specific competitor.
- **Competitor Intel** — pull pre-saved intelligence from public sources (websites, G2, LinkedIn, etc.).
- **Knowledge Base** — search your company's internal messaging docs, playbooks, and enablement content.
- **Web Search** — live web search for real-time competitor information, news, and product updates.
- **Scrape URL** — extract and analyze content from specific web pages (pricing pages, docs, blogs).
- **Map URL** *(experimental)* — discover and index subpages from a given URL to find all relevant content on a site.
- **Browse Tool** *(experimental)* — full browser capabilities for research on specialized or bot-protected sources like LinkedIn.

### Data Analysis
- **Analyze Segment** — segment a dataset using filters and generate insights. **Only available in Data Analysis mode**.

Hindsight always shows you which tool is being used, and what sources were found within the chat window.

## Chaining Tools
Think of the tools as building blocks:
- **Select Deals / Search Deals / Search Across Deal Documents** — find the right deals.
- **Search Within Deal** — pull specific details and quotes from deals.
- **Competitor Assets / Competitor Intel / Knowledge Base** — layer in competitive context and your company's positioning.
- **Web Search / Scrape URL / Map URL / Browse Tool** — fill gaps with live web information.

Let the model decide how to use these tools to accomplish your task, or provide specific instructions for the model to follow. Once you have the right context, the rest is simple prompting to get your ideal output.

## Use Cases

### 1. Messaging

#### Simple example
> "Summarize how we won the Acme Corp deal against Competitor A. What messaging resonated most with the buyer?"

#### Powerful example
> "Search deals that involved our Workflows and Approvals feature. Search those deals deal by deal and answer these questions: What pain points did buyers raise? How did reps message this in wins? 
Compare buyer needs and messaging in lost deals. Create a persona breakdown plus messaging and objection-handling guides."

### 2. Competitive Asset Creation

#### Simple example
> "Generate a battlecard for Competitor B — highlight top objections and our best responses."

#### Powerful example
> "Search deals we won vs. Competitor B. Summarize where we win. Then search deals we lost and analyze why we lost. Include key product comparisons, and pricing references. Combine into a one-pager with objection handling and differentiated messaging."

### 3. Product Insights

#### Simple example
> "Search for mentions of our Reporting Dashboard. What problems did buyers highlight?"

#### Powerful example
> "Find deals lost due to reporting limitations. Then compare to wins where reporting was cited positively. Summarize buyer needs, gaps, and feature requests into a report for the product team."

### 4. Sales Coaching

#### Simple example
> "Show me questions buyers asked in lost deals with Competitor C."

#### Powerful example
> "Search deals lost to Competitor C in the past quarter. Identify the toughest buyer objections and compare how top-performing reps vs. others responded. Turn this into a coaching guide with recommended talk tracks."

### 5. Handoffs

#### Simple example
> "Summarize the Acme Corp deal for the implementation team — key buyer needs and objections."

#### Powerful example
> "I'm creating a handoff document for the Acme Corp deal. Highlight buyer expectations, key risks, and commitments made. Find similar deals with similar risks and see if there's anything we can learn from them. Format as an onboarding brief for Customer Success."

### 6. Reports

#### Simple example
> "Create a weekly summary of deals lost due to pricing."

#### Powerful example
> "Search Across Deals for closed-lost due to pricing in the past quarter. Break down by competitor and buyer persona. Highlight common negotiation patterns and summarize into a pricing strategy report."

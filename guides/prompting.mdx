## Concepts to Learn

### Context Engineering
The AI’s power comes from the data it pulls in. Be clear about the task and steps (“create objection handling for Competitor X”), and Hindsight will retrieve the right context from the right places -  e.g. the right transcripts, CRM notes, or competitive intel.

### Context Overflow
AI chats work best in focused threads. Start a new conversation for each distinct task (e.g., one for pricing analysis, one for coaching prep) to avoid oversaturating the AI’s attention span with too much irrelevant context.

## Tools
- **Search Within Deal** — look inside one deal’s transcripts, CRM fields, notes.
- **Deal Search** — filter deals by name, stage, competitor, amount, close date.
- **Search Across Deals** — broad scan for themes and examples (e.g. GDPR).
- **Competitor Search** — pull intelligence on one competitor.

Hindsight always shows you which tool is being used, and what sources were found within the chat window.

## Chaining Tools
Think of the primitives as building blocks:
- **Deal Search / Search Across Deals** — find the right deals.
- **Search Within Deal** — pull details.
- **Competitor Search** — layer in market context.

Let the model decide how to use these tools to accomplish your task, or provide specific instructions for the model to follow. Once you have the right context, the rest is simple prompting to get your ideal output.

Combine these tools with the “Create Asset” functionality to synthesize instantly into shareable messaging, reports, or guides.

## Use Cases

### 1. Messaging

#### Simple example
> “Summarize how we won the Acme Corp deal against Competitor A. What messaging resonated most with the buyer?”

#### Powerful example
> “Search deals we won because of Workflows and Approvals. What pain points did buyers raise? How did reps message this? Then search lost deals where the product came up. Compare buyer needs. Create a persona breakdown plus messaging and objection-handling guides.”

### 2. Competitive Asset Creation

#### Simple example
> “Generate a quick battlecard for Competitor B — highlight top objections and our best responses.”

#### Powerful example
> “Search Across Deals for mentions of Competitor B. Summarize where we win vs. lose, key product comparisons, and pricing references. Combine into a one-pager with objection handling and differentiated messaging.”

### 3. Product Insights

#### Simple example
> “Search for mentions of our Reporting Dashboard. What problems did buyers highlight?”

#### Powerful example
> “Find deals lost due to reporting limitations. Then compare to wins where reporting was cited positively. Summarize buyer needs, gaps, and feature requests into a report for the product team.”

### 4. Sales Coaching

#### Simple example
> “Show me questions buyers asked in lost deals with Competitor C.”

#### Powerful example
> “Search deals lost to Competitor C in the past quarter. Identify the toughest buyer objections and compare how top-performing reps vs. others responded. Turn this into a coaching guide with recommended talk tracks.”

### 5. Handoffs

#### Simple example
> “Summarize the Acme Corp deal for the implementation team — key buyer needs and objections.”

#### Powerful example
> “I’m creating a handoff document for the Acme Corp deal. Highlight buyer expectations, key risks, and commitments made. Find similar deals with similar risks and see if there’s anything we can learn from them. Format as an onboarding brief for Customer Success.”

### 6. Reports

#### Simple example
> “Create a weekly summary of deals lost due to pricing.”

#### Powerful example
> “Search Across Deals for closed-lost due to pricing in the past quarter. Break down by competitor and buyer persona. Highlight common negotiation patterns and summarize into a pricing strategy report.”

# Product Manager's Guide to Hindsight

Hindsight transforms how Product Managers gather competitive intelligence, understand customer needs, and make data-driven product decisions. This guide covers the key features most relevant to Product Management teams.

## The Product Manager's Challenge

Most product teams struggle with the same fundamental issues:

**Before Hindsight:**
1. **Anecdotes and loud voices drive product priorities** - the squeakiest wheel gets the grease
2. **Manual digging for field insights** - spending hours in Gong recordings and Salesforce notes, or constantly asking sales for their opinion
3. **No way to quantify trends** - unable to measure which features actually drive revenue impact

This makes it nearly impossible to identify what to build, fix, or invest in to drive the most revenue.

**With Hindsight:**
Transform anecdotes into data-driven roadmaps with quantifiable impacts and qualitative insights:
1. **Understand what features are driving impact** - see which capabilities win and lose deals
2. **Identify opportunities to close feature gaps** - know exactly where competitors beat you
3. **Access a detailed quote bank** - hear what buyers are actually saying about features

All insights are automatically pulled from your deal data - no manual analysis required.

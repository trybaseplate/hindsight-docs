Most teams rely on reps to fill out dropdown lists and type notes when deals close. This approach has several problems:

- **Inaccurate data** — Reps rush through forms or forget details
- **Biased responses** — Self-reporting creates inherent bias
- **Hard to act on** — Generic fields don't capture nuanced insights
- **Incomplete coverage** — Only covers deals reps remember to update

Traditional win-loss interviews are better but expensive, time-consuming, and only cover a small sample of deals.

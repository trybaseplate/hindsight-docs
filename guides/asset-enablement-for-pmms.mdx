This guide helps Product Marketing Managers (PMMs) and enablement teams create high-quality competitive assets and messaging docs that empower sales reps to win more deals. 
Learn how to use Hindsight's Create Assets workflow, monitor rep usage, and continuously improve your competitive enablement.

## Prerequisites: Connect Your Sales Tools

Before creating assets, ensure your foundational data sources are connected. Sales reps' questions in Slack will only be as good as the data they're sourced from.

### Helpful Data Sources

<Steps>
  <Step title="Your CRM">
    **Required if you want insights directly from deals**
    - **Salesforce** or **HubSpot** integration with admin access
    - Enables automatic deal import and analysis
    - Provides deal context for competitive insights
    - **Setup**: [Salesforce Integration](/integrations/salesforce-integration) | [HubSpot Integration](/integrations/hubspot-integration)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Meeting Transcripts">
    - **Gong**, **Clari**, **Outreach**, or similar tools
    - Captures buyer-seller conversations
    - Extracts competitive mentions and objections
    - **Alternative**: Use [Zapier integration](/integrations/zapier) for unsupported tools
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Win-Loss Interviews">
    - Run Win-Loss interviews within Hindsight
    - Collects direct feedback on competitive positioning
    - **Setup**: [Slack Integration](/integrations/slack)
  </Step>
</Steps>

If you don't connect these data sources, Hindsight will default to publicly available competitive intelligence, which may not be as relevant or accurate.

## Create Assets Workflow

Leverage sales insights and turn them into shareable, searchable assets that power sales enablement.

### Step 1: Identify Asset Gaps in Library

Start by reviewing your current competitive coverage to identify where assets are needed:

**Navigate to Asset Library:**
1. Go to [Asset Library](https://app.usehindsight.com/library/documents) in Hindsight
2. Review the competitor overview showing progress indicators
3. Identify competitors with missing or incomplete asset coverage
4. Click "Create Assets" for any competitor needing competitive intelligence

### Step 2: Generate Content with AI Chat or Templates

Create assets using either AI-powered content generation or pre-built templates:

**Option A: (RECOMMENDED) Guided Content Generation**

Leverage pre-built templates for consistent, high-quality assets:

**Quick Setup**: Go to **Asset Library** → Select competitor → "Create Assets"

**Prompts pre-built for you**: Competitive Battlecard, Objection Handling, Pricing Strategy, Discovery Question, Demo Talk Track, Customer Stories

**What happens when you select a template:**
1. **Auto-filled prompt**: The system automatically generates a detailed, strategic prompt tailored to the asset type and competitor
2. **Redirect to chat**: You're taken directly to the AI chat interface with the prompt pre-loaded
3. **Review and refine**: Verify the generated content and use the chat to:
   - Ask for additional context or sources
   - Request specific deal examples or customer quotes
   - Refine messaging for different audiences (enterprise vs. SMB)
   - Add recent competitive intelligence or market updates
   - Incorporate feedback from recent deals or rep insights

**Option B: Custom Content**
Write you own prompts for unique asset needs, such as vertical specific battlecards (or literally anything you want):

### Step 3: Create Asset from AI Response

When you have a document that you like:
1. **Click "Create Asset"** in the footer menu bar of the AI response
2. **Add descriptive title** (e.g., "Salesforce Enterprise Objection Guide Q4 2024")
3. **Tag competitor** for organization and discoverability
4. **Asset automatically saved** to Asset library, now available for the AI Agent to search in Slack.

### Step 4: Import Existing Competitive Intelligence

For content you already have:
1. **Upload documents** to the Asset Library from Google Drive, Confluence, Notion, or local files
2. **Tag with appropriate competitors** for organization and discoverability
3. **Add an asset type** to move your progress bar

These documents are now searchable by the AI Agent in Slack along with your Hindsight-built assets.

## Monitor Rep Usage and Questions

Understanding how sales reps use assets helps you improve enablement quality and identify content gaps.

### Viewing Rep Activity

**Chat Reports and Analytics:**
- **Access**: Navigate to your admin dashboard analytics section
- **View**: Rep questions, response patterns, and asset usage
- **Filter**: By time period, competitor, or question type

**Key Metrics to Track:**
- **Question volume**: How many questions reps ask per week
- **Response success rate**: Percentage of questions that receive helpful answers
- **Asset usage**: Which competitors are asked about most frequently
- **Common topics**: Trending themes in rep questions

### Identifying Content Gaps

**Signs of Content Gaps:**
- **Unanswered questions**: Reps getting "no results found" responses
- **Repeat questions**: Same questions asked multiple times
- **Low asset usage**: Specific competitors with minimal asset engagement
- **Feedback requests**: Reps asking for specific competitive intel

## Refining Content Based on Usage

Use rep feedback and usage patterns to continuously improve asset quality.

### Setting Up Rep Access

**Slack Commands for Reps:**
- `/assets [competitor]` - List all assets for specific competitor
- `@hindsight [question]` - Ask competitive questions with AI responses

**Channel Integration:**
- **Deal Channels**: Auto-suggest relevant assets during deal discussions
- **Competitive Channels**: Share new assets and competitive updates
- **Team Channels**: Broadcast new battlecards and objection guides

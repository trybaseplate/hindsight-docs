This guide helps Product Marketing Managers (PMMs) and enablement teams create high-quality competitive assets that empower sales reps to win more deals. Learn how to use Hindsight's Create Assets workflow, monitor rep usage, and continuously improve your competitive enablement.

## Prerequisites: Connect Your Sales Tools

Before creating assets, ensure your foundational data sources are connected. Sales reps' questions in Slack will only be as good as the data they're sourced from.

## Create Assets Workflow

Transform AI chat insights into shareable, searchable assets that power sales enablement.

### Step 1: Identify Asset Gaps in Library

Start by reviewing your current competitive coverage to identify where assets are needed:

**Navigate to Asset Library:**
1. Go to (Asset Library)[https://app.usehindsight.com/library/documents] in Hindsight
2. Review the competitor overview showing progress indicators
3. Identify competitors with missing or incomplete asset coverage
4. Click "Create Assets" for any competitor needing competitive intelligence

**Quick Gap Assessment:**
- **Zero Assets**: Competitors with no battlecards, objection guides, or pricing intelligence
- **Incomplete Coverage**: Competitors missing key asset types (pricing, objections, features)
- **Outdated Content**: Assets older than 3 months that need refreshing
- **High-Priority Competitors**: Focus on competitors appearing frequently in active deals

### Step 2: Generate Content with AI Chat or Templates

Create assets using either AI-powered content generation or pre-built templates:

**Option A: AI-Generated Content**
Start with strategic questions that pull from your verified data sources:

**Competitive Positioning Examples:**
> "Search deals we won against Salesforce in enterprise accounts. What messaging resonated most with buyers?"

> "Find lost deals where pricing was mentioned as an objection. How did top performers handle price conversations vs. others?"

**Objection Handling Examples:**
> "Search for mentions of security concerns across all deals. Create comprehensive objection handling for enterprise security buyers."

> "What integration questions do prospects ask most often, and how do we typically respond?"

**Option B: (RECOMMENDED) Use Default Prompts for Quick Asset Creation**

Leverage pre-built templates for consistent, high-quality assets:

**Quick Setup**: Go to **Asset Library** → Select competitor → "Create Assets"

**Templates pre-built for you**: Competitive Battlecard, Objection Handling, Pricing Strategy, Discovery Question, Demo Talk Track, Customer Stories

**What happens when you select a template:**
1. **Auto-filled prompt**: The system automatically generates a detailed, strategic prompt tailored to the asset type and competitor
2. **Redirect to chat**: You're taken directly to the AI chat interface with the prompt pre-loaded
3. **Review and refine**: Verify the generated content and use the chat to:
   - Ask for additional context or sources
   - Request specific deal examples or customer quotes
   - Refine messaging for different audiences (enterprise vs. SMB)
   - Add recent competitive intelligence or market updates
   - Incorporate feedback from recent deals or rep insights

### Step 3: Create Asset from AI Response

When you have a document that you like:
1. **Click "Create Asset"** on the AI response
2. **Add descriptive title** (e.g., "Salesforce Enterprise Objection Guide Q4 2024")
3. **Tag competitor** for organization and discoverability
4. **Asset automatically saved** to Asset library with full search indexing

### Step 4: Import Existing Competitive Intelligence

For content you already have:
1. **Upload documents** to the Asset Library from Google Drive, Confluence, Notion, or local files
2. **Tag with appropriate competitors**
3. **Add descriptive metadata** for searchability
4. **Use existing content** as source material for AI-generated assets

## Monitor Rep Usage and Questions

Understanding how sales reps use assets helps you improve enablement quality and identify content gaps.

### Viewing Rep Activity

**Chat Reports and Analytics:**
- **Access**: Navigate to your admin dashboard analytics section
- **View**: Rep questions, response patterns, and asset usage
- **Filter**: By time period, team, competitor, or question type

**Key Metrics to Track:**
- **Question volume**: How many questions reps ask per week
- **Response success rate**: Percentage of questions that receive helpful answers
- **Asset usage**: Which assets are accessed most frequently
- **Common topics**: Trending themes in rep questions

### Identifying Content Gaps

**Signs of Content Gaps:**
- **Unanswered questions**: Reps getting "no results found" responses
- **Repeat questions**: Same questions asked multiple times
- **Low asset usage**: Specific competitors with minimal asset engagement
- **Feedback requests**: Reps asking for specific competitive intel

**Example Gap Analysis:**
- Reps frequently ask about "Competitor X pricing" but no pricing assets exist
- Security questions are common but no security-focused battlecards available
- Integration objections come up often but no technical comparison guides

### Common Rep Question Patterns

**Simple Competitor Questions** (Easy wins):
- "Does Competitor A support SSO?"
- "How does Competitor B price enterprise?"
- "What are our strengths vs. Competitor C?"

**Deal-Specific Questions** (Require deal context):
- "What objections came up in the Acme deal?"
- "How did we handle pricing in similar deals?"
- "What worked in enterprise deals vs. Competitor X?"

**Complex Strategic Questions** (Need comprehensive assets):
- "Create a battlecard for the Microsoft deal"
- "Write an email explaining our differentiators vs. Competitor Y"
- "Generate a proposal response to this RFP section"

## Refining Content Based on Usage

Use rep feedback and usage patterns to continuously improve asset quality.

## Best Practices for Enablement Success

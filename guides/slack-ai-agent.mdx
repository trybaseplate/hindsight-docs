Hindsight's AI agent is available directly in Slack, giving sales reps instant access to deal insights and competitive intelligence without leaving their workflow. The Slack agent is designed specifically for sales teams with curated access to verified data sources.

## Key Differences: Slack vs. In-App Chat

### Slack Agent (Sales-Focused)
- **Limited to verified sources** — Only analyzed deals and approved sales assets
- **Streamlined for sales workflows** — Quick answers and tactical outputs
- **No raw data access** — Can't search unprocessed transcripts, notes, or competitive intel
- **Optimized for curated answers** — Less exploratory, more replicable and consistent responses

### In-App Chat (Full Platform)
- **Access to all data sources** — Raw transcripts, CRM fields, unprocessed notes
- **Advanced analytics** — Complex queries across entire dataset
- **Custom data sources** — Can pull from any connected integration
- **Full tool suite** — Complete search and analysis capabilities

## Available Data Sources in Slack

### ✅ What You Can Access
- **Analyzed Deals** — Deals that have been analyzed by Hindsight
- **Sales Assets** — Battlecards, messaging guides, and competitive intel uploaded by your team or created in Hindsight
- **Approved Competitive Intelligence** — Vetted competitor data and positioning
- **Team-Created Content** — Objection handling guides, talk tracks, and templates

### ❌ What You Cannot Access
- **Raw Competitive Intelligence** — Unverified content from public data sources
- **Full CRM Database** — Direct access to all CRM fields and records
- **External Data Sources** — Unconnected or unverified integrations

## How to Use the Slack Agent

### Getting Started
1. Add the Hindsight bot to your Slack workspace
2. Use `@hindsight` or DM the bot directly
3. Ask questions naturally — the agent will find relevant verified sources

### Quick Commands
- `@hindsight <your queestion>` - AI agent searches verified data sources and provides an answer
- `/assets [competitor name]` — List all available assets and competitive intelligence for a specific competitor with direct links

## Use Cases for Sales Reps

### 1. Simple Competitor Questions

Get quick answers about competitors using verified intelligence.

#### Examples:
> "Does Competitor A support SSO integration?"

> "How does Competitor B typically price their enterprise plan?"

> "What are our main strengths vs. Competitor C in the mid-market?"

**What you'll see:** The agent will show `Found (N) results in <competitor_name>` followed by sources linking to specific assets, battlecards, and competitive intelligence documents, then an answer.

**What you get:** Direct answers sourced from approved competitive intelligence curated by your team.

### 2. Simple Deal Questions

Access insights from specific deals that have been analyzed in Hindsight.

#### Examples:
> "What pain points did the prospect in the Acme Corp deal ask about?"

> "What objections came up in the TechStart deal and how did we handle them?"

> "Why did we win the GlobalTech deal against Competitor X?"

**What you'll see:** The agent will display `Found (N) deals:` with a list of relevant deals and their key insights, then an answer.

**What you get:** Key insights, objections, and outcomes from deals based on your CRM and call data.

### 3. Complex Queries & Task Assistance

Generate sales assets and tactical outputs for active deals.

#### Examples:
> "Create a battlecard to help me compete against Competitor A in the MegaCorp deal"

> "Write an email response explaining our differentiators vs. Competitor B and where we typically win"

> "Generate a handoff document for the Enterprise Inc deal highlighting key buyer needs and commitments"

**What you'll see:** The agent will show a combination of multiple steps: searching for relevant deals, pulling competitive intelligence, and synthesizing information. You'll see progress indicators like `Searching deals...`, `Found results in <competitor_name>`, `Found (N) deals:`, followed by the generated output.

**What you get:** Ready-to-use sales assets, email drafts, and handoff documents based on verified data.

## Best Practices for Slack Usage

### Quick Asset Discovery
Use `/assets [competitor name]` to quickly see all available competitive intelligence and assets for a specific competitor. This command provides direct links to battlecards, messaging guides, and competitive analysis documents.

### Be Specific
- **Good:** "What pricing objections came up in deals against Competitor A?"
- **Better:** "What pricing objections came up in enterprise deals against Competitor A in Q3?"


## Example Workflows

### Pre-Call Preparation
1. `@hindsight what do I need to know about Competitor X for today's call with Acme Corp.?`
2. `@hindsight what objections typically come up against Competitor X?`
3. `@hindsight what's our best message against Competitor X when they bring up self-hosting capabilities?`

### Mid-Deal Support
1. `@hindsight how did we handle [specific objection] in deals we won vs Competitor Z?`
2. `@hindsight create a talk track for [specific use case] vs. Competitor Z in our Acme deal`
3. `@hindsight what questions should I ask to highlight our strengths vs. Competitor Z?`

### Post-Deal
1. `@hindsight write a follow-up email addressing [specific concern] about competitor's feature support`
2. `@hindsight create a comparison one-pager for [specific features] vs. Competitor Y and Z`
3. `@hindsight generate a handoff document highlighting the core problems we solved for the customer`

## Getting Help

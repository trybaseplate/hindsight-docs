Reports in Hindsight transform your deal data into actionable business insights through AI-powered analysis. This guide walks you through the complete process of creating, customizing, and sharing reports that drive strategic decision-making.

## Before You Start

### Prerequisites
- At least 10-15 deals in your Hindsight database for meaningful analysis
- Deals with sufficient context (CRM data, call transcripts, notes, or summaries)
- Clear business questions you want your report to answer

### Types of Questions Reports Can Answer
- **Win/Loss Analysis**: What factors drive successful deals vs. losses?
- **Competitive Intelligence**: How are we performing against specific competitors?
- **Product Insights**: What features are most requested or create friction?
- **Sales Performance**: How effective are our sales processes and methodologies?
- **Market Trends**: What patterns emerge across different segments or time periods?

## Step 1: Define Your Dataset

### Navigate to Reports
1. Go to the **Reports** tab in your Hindsight dashboard
2. Click **Create New Report** to open the report builder

### Apply Strategic Filters
Think carefully about what data will answer your business question:

**Deal Status Filtering**
- **Closed Won + Closed Lost**: For comprehensive win/loss analysis
- **Closed Won only**: To understand success patterns
- **Closed Lost only**: To identify failure modes
- **Open Deals**: For pipeline health and current trends

**Time Period Selection**
- **Recent data (30-90 days)**: For current market conditions
- **Quarterly analysis**: For performance reviews and planning
- **Year-over-year**: For trend analysis and strategic planning
- **Custom ranges**: For specific campaign or product launch periods

**Segment Focus**
- **New Business**: For acquisition strategy insights
- **Expansion/Upsell**: For growth strategy analysis  
- **Renewal**: For retention and customer success insights
- **Specific Products**: For product-specific market intelligence

### Sample Dataset Configurations

## Step 2: Configure Your Columns

### Default Fields (Always Included)

- **Competition**: Competitive factors and mentions
- **Features**: Product capabilities discussed or requested  
- **Metrics**: Deal size, timeline, and quantitative data
- **Summary**: Contextual insights about deal outcomes

### Adding Custom Fields
Enhance your analysis by including relevant business context. This includes any of your synced CRM fields and other Hindsight-generated insights.

**Account Properties**
- Company size (employee count, revenue)

### Column Selection Strategy
- **Start comprehensive**: Include more fields initially, then refine
- **Match your questions**: Ensure columns support your analysis goals
- **Consider correlations**: Include fields that might reveal unexpected patterns
- **Balance detail vs. clarity**: Too many columns can dilute insights

## Step 3: Generate and Review

### Create Your Report
1. Review your dataset configuration in the preview table
2. Verify you have sufficient deal volume (10+ deals minimum)
3. Click **Create Report** to begin AI analysis
4. Download the CSV if you want to review raw data

### Understanding the AI Process
The AI analyzes your dataset through several stages:
1. **Data Synthesis**: Reviews all deal information and context
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies trends and correlations
3. **Insight Extraction**: Generates specific findings and recommendations
4. **Report Structuring**: Organizes insights into logical sections

### Initial Report Review
When your report generates, look for:
- **Data coverage**: Confirms the right deals were included
- **Insight quality**: Specific, actionable findings vs. generic observations
- **Evidence backing**: Claims supported by deal examples and data
- **Logical structure**: Clear flow from overview to specific insights

## Step 4: Customize Your Analysis

### Prompt Customization
Before generating, you can modify the AI prompt to focus on specific areas:

**Standard Win/Loss Prompt**
```
Analyze this dataset for overall win/loss patterns, competitive factors, 
and sales execution insights. Focus on actionable recommendations.
```

**Competitive-Focused Prompt**  
```
Focus specifically on competitive dynamics. Identify which competitors 
we're losing to, why we win against others, and messaging gaps.
```

**Product-Focused Prompt**
```
Emphasize product-related insights including feature requests, 
objections, and competitive product comparisons.
```

**Sales Process Prompt**
```
Analyze sales methodology effectiveness, deal progression patterns, 
and coaching opportunities for the sales team.
```

### Report Type Selection
Choose the analysis approach that matches your needs:
- **Executive Summary**: High-level insights for leadership
- **Tactical Deep Dive**: Detailed analysis for practitioners
- **Competitive Brief**: Market and competitor focus
- **Product Feedback**: Feature and development insights

## Step 5: Refine and Extend

### Conversational Follow-Up
After your initial report, continue the analysis:

**Ask Specific Questions**
- "What are the top 3 objections in lost deals?"
- "How do win rates differ by company size?"
- "Which features are mentioned most in closed won deals?"

**Request Different Perspectives**
- "Analyze this data from a sales coaching perspective"
- "What would a product manager need to know from this data?"
- "How should marketing adjust messaging based on these insights?"

**Drill Down on Findings**
- "Show me specific examples of the pricing objections mentioned"
- "Which deals exemplify the competitive wins against [competitor]?"
- "What's the common thread in deals that mention [feature]?"

### Iterative Improvement
Refine your report through multiple iterations:
1. **First pass**: Get overall patterns and high-level insights
2. **Second pass**: Focus on specific findings that need deeper analysis  
3. **Third pass**: Extract actionable recommendations and next steps
4. **Final pass**: Prepare insights for specific stakeholder audiences

## Step 6: Share and Act

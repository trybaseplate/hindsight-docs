# Get Admin Permissions (if neccessary)
If you are not an admin of your Slack workspace, you may need to request admin permissions to add Hindsight to your workspace. This is required to allow Hindsight to send notifications and deliver battlecards to your sales team.
Once approved, you'll have to add Hindsight to your workspace again. Click "Connect" on the [integrations](https://app.usehindsight.com/settings/integrations) page and follow the authorization steps again.

# Add to Slack Channels
Once Hindsight is added to your Slack workspace, you can add it to specific channels. This will allow Hindsight to send notifications and deliver battlecards to those channels.

# Get battlecards
You can get battlecards in Slack by typing ```/battlecard [competitor name]``` in any channel where Hindsight is added. This will deliver a simplified view of the battlecard directly to that channel.

# Add Competitive Intel
You can add intelligence from Slack into Hindsight by using the 3 dot menu on any message. Click "More actions" and select "Add to Hindsight". This will allow you to add competitive insights from your Slack conversations directly into Hindsight for analysis.

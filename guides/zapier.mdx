### Overview
Hindsight's Zapier integration allows you to connect thousands of apps without needing us to build a native integration. This guide will help you set up the integration and start using it effectively.
Most commonly, the Zapier integration is used to connect meeting notetakers to automatically import your sales calls and meetings. This helps our AI extract competitive insights from your sales conversations.

# Create an API key
Generate an API key from the [API Keys](https://app.usehindsight.com/settings/keys) page. You’ll use this key in step 3 to authenticate with your Hindsight account in Zapier

# Create a Zap
You can use one of our prebuilt Zap templates from the Integrations page or create a custom Zap. You can find the templates on the [Integrations](https://app.usehindsight.com/settings/integrations) page. 
When creating a Zap, you'll need to select a trigger app and an action app. The trigger app is the app that will send data to Hindsight, and the action app is Hindsight itself.

# Authenticate your DealPage account
You will paste your API key in the Accounts tab to authenticate your Hindsight account. This will allow Zapier to send data to your Hindsight account.

# Create a Zap Action
Select the Hindsight app and choose the Create Document action. This will allow you to create a new document in your Hindsight account whenever the Zap is triggered.

# Map your fields
Map the fields from your trigger app to the fields in Hindsight. This will allow you to send data from your trigger app to Hindsight when the Zap is triggered.

# Test your Zap
Test your Zap to make sure everything is working correctly. This will send a test document to your Hindsight account.

# Turn on your Zap
Once you’ve tested your Zap and everything is working correctly, turn on your Zap to start sending data to your Hindsight account.

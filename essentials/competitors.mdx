## Overview
Hindsight allows you to **gather publicly available information about your competitors**  using AI. This includes monitoring each competitor's website, social media, and other online sources for updates on product launches, pricing changes, and other relevant news.
If you've used Deep Research before, this is similar but with a more streamlined experience.

### Sources Monitored
- **Website**: Monitor your competitors' websites for changes in content, product offerings, and pricing. Provide one URL and our AI will monitor the entire site. You can also add documentation sites and support sites.
- **Social Media**: Track your competitors' social media accounts on LinkedIn and Twitter for updates on new products, promotions, and customer engagement.
- **News Articles**: Stay informed about your competitors through news articles and press releases.
- **Job Postings**: Analyze your competitors' hiring trends and job postings to gain insights into their growth and focus areas.
- **Customer Reviews**: Monitor customer feedback and reviews on sites like G2, Capterra, and various blogs to understand how your competitors are perceived in the market.
- **Marketing Campaigns**: Analyze your competitors' paid marketing campaigns on Google and LinkedIn to understand their strategies and messaging.

### How it Works
Hindsight uses AI Agents to monitor your competitor's activity. Under the hood, our AI Agents are writing and rewriting queries, and using a broswer to get into all the places a human would to find intel.

All you need to do is provide a URL.

1. **AI Finds Relevant Content**: Our AI agents will crawl the web and find sources to monitor for you, no manual input required.
2. **Daily Sync**: Hindsight will sync the latest data from your competitors every 24 hours, ensuring you have the most up-to-date information.
3. **Alerts and Notifications**: Hindsight creates a weekly newsletter and notifications when significant changes occur, such as new product launches or pricing updates.

## See insights
### News Feed
On your [Competitors](https://app.usehindsight.com/competitors) page, you can view a news feed of the latest updates from your competitors. This feed includes articles, social media posts, and other relevant content that our AI has found. You can filter the feed by source or type of content to focus on what matters most to you.
You can also delete any irrelevant content from the feed to keep it clean and focused.

## Set Up
### Adding Competitors
On the [Competitors](https://app.usehindsight.com/competitors) page, you can add your competitors by URL. You can also add specific instructions for our AI agents to follow when tracking your competitors.

### Customizing Sources
You can customize the sources that Hindsight monitors for each competitor in [Competitor Monitoring](https://app.usehindsight.com/settings/competitor-monitoring). This allows you to focus on the most relevant information for your business. For example, if you don't want to monitor LinkedIn, you can turn that off.

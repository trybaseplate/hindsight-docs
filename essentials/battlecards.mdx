Sales battlecards are a critical resource for sales teams, providing them with the competitive insights they need to win deals. Hindsight's battlecards are personalized and auto-updated based on your sales data, ensuring that your team always has the most relevant information at their fingertips.

## Prerequisites
1. CRM integration: Battlecards rely on competitive insights that come directly from your buyers. Follow the [Quickstart](https://docs.usehindsight.com/quickstart) guide for setup.
2. Adding Competitors: Follow the [Competitor Monitoring](http://docs.usehindsight.com/essentials/competitors) guide to add your competitors

## How it Works
When Hindsight analyzes your CRM and/or call data, it extracts competitive insights. **These are typically quotes from your buyers explaining why they chose you over a competitor, or why they chose a competitor over you.**
Hindsight uses these insights to generate personalized battlecards for your sales team. When new intelligence comes in, Hindsight automatically suggests updates.

## Cards
Battlecards are composed of individual cards, each focused on a specific insight that can help you win deals. Each card is powered by a unique workflow that pulls in relevant data from your CRM, call data, win-loss interviews, and competitive insights.
Cards are editable, allowing you to customize the content and layout to fit your team's needs.
